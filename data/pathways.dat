COMMENT - The polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, and |FRAME:SPERMINE|) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes |CITS: [3157043][4873311][1409623][2185470]|. While it is clear that polyamines are essential for normal cell growth, we still do not fully understand their specific molecular functions <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[3157043]|. |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| are found in all life forms, and |FRAME:SPERMINE| is found mostly in eukaryotes. A few bacterial species that were reported to contain |FRAME:SPERMINE| include |FRAME: TAX-287| |CITS:[4875413]| and |FRAME: TAX-1422| |CITS: [13538999]|.
/
/
/Unlike |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, |FRAME:SPERMINE| is not essential for viability in eukaryotes. Exogenous |FRAME:SPERMINE| supported growth of |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|-depleted cells only after its degradation into |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| |CITS: [kramer96]| and |FRAME:SPERMINE|-defficient transgenic mice, which were generated by eliminating the SpmS gene, located on the X chromosome, were viable |CITS: [ 9467015]|.  Although, the lack of |FRAME:SPERMINE| biosynthesis resulted in a phenotype in affected males that included symptoms of circling behavior, hyperactivity, head shaking, inner ear abnormalities, deafness, sterility, a profound postnatal growth retardation, and a propensity to sudden death. The symptoms were eliminated when the gene was overexpressed in the mice. These results showed that |FRAME:SPERMINE| synthesis is needed for normal growth, viability, and fertility in male mice |CITS: [15459188]|.
/
/In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> the lack of |FRAME:YLR146C| had no obvious manifestation on the mutant phenotype and the homozygous &Delta;spe4 diploid cells sporulated normally indicating that |FRAME:SPERMINE| in yeast was not essential for growth and development. Hence, the role of |FRAME:SPERMINE| in yeast remains unclear and needs further research. The high amino acid identity (50%) between the |FRAME:YPR069C-MONOMER| and |FRAME:YLR146C-MONOMER| prompted the suggestion that |FRAME:YLR146C-MONOMER| may have been descended from |FRAME:YPR069C-MONOMER| by gene duplication |CITS:[9573363]|.
/
/|FRAME:SPERMINE| is formed by the addition of a propylamine moiety to |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, catalyzed by an aminopropyltransferase termed |FRAME: CPLX-6908|. The source of the propylamine group is decarboxylated |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (|FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINAMINE|) which is produced by the action of the pyruvoyl-containing enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-6906|. The other product of the aminopropyltransferase reaction is |FRAME:5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA), which is recycled back to |FRAME: MET|.

COMMENT - The pathway of phosphatidylglycerol degradation is an example of an unique regulation mechanism for the biosynthesis of |FRAME:CPD-12824| (see |FRAME:PWY-5269|). Cardiolipin (CL) is the major anionic phospholipid in mitochondria with important functions for growth, energy-related processes and biogenesis (reviewed in |CITS:[10799718] [18725250] [23172229]|. Phosphatidylglycerol, an intermediate in the biosynthetic route to cardiolipin, is also an essential lipid in chloroplast membranes |CITS:[15538651]| but occurs in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> in only small amounts. Of major interest in yeast is its role of an intermediate in the cardiolipin biosynthesis |CITS:[9614098]| but it also has been reported to play a role in the <i>in vivo</i> activation of enzymes involved in the generation of bioactive ceramides |CITS:[15611094]|. 
/
/The regulation of the flux of |FRAME:L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL| towards |FRAME:CPD-12824| in yeast appears to be managed through an pathway removing excessive amounts of |FRAME:L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL| by hydrolytic cleavage of this intermediary lipid. The resulting |FRAME:DIACYLGLYCEROL| and |FRAME:GLYCEROL-3P| can be reused in the mitochondria under special conditions. It had been demonstrated that &Delta;pgc1 and the wild type have no different growth phenotypes which prompted the proposition that the pathway serves as fine adjustment for the cardiolipin biosynthesis |CITS:[18434318]|. The enzymatic activity of the PGC1 product is that of a phosphatidylglycerol phospholipase C |CITS:[18434318]| and not as a  glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase involved in the metabolism of glycerophosphocholine and glycerophosphoinositol as previously considered based on homology to enzymes in other organisms  |CITS:[16172116]|. It was shown that the &Delta;pgc1 mutant significantly accumulated phosphatidylglycerol in comparison to the wild type because the "removal pathway" of surplus |FRAME:L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL| catalyzed by the phosphatidylglycerol phospholipase C (PGC1) was not operating |CITS:[18434318]|. The absence of inositol amplified the accumulation effect in the &Delta;pgc1 mutant as inositol is a negative regulator of phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase which in turn increased the flow of |FRAME:L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL| in the cardiolipin biosynthesis |CITS:[12821656]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME:PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE Phosphatidylcholine|, a major membrane lipid in eukaryotes, can be produced in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> in two pathways |CITS:[12627972]|, the CDP-choline biosynthetic route via |FRAME:CHOLINE| (see |FRAME:PWY3O-450|) |CITS:[20503434]| and the triple methylation pathway via |FRAME:ETHANOL-AMINE| (see |FRAME:PWY-6825|) |CITS:[2198947]|. It is also known that both yeast and mammals can deacylate |FRAME:PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE| to form |FRAME:L-1-GLYCERO-PHOSPHORYLCHOLINE| |CITS:[11078727]|.  <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> employs a pathway which recycles |FRAME:PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE| (this pathway), contributes to the homeostasis of membrane lipids, and provides a compound that can cover the complete demand for phosphor in the cell |CITS:[16172116] [19841481]|. In addition, excess |FRAME:PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE| can be avoided which has been reported to be intrinsically toxic to the secretory function of the yeast Golgi apparatus |CITS:[11294911]|.
/
/Two enzymes are involved in the resynthesis of |FRAME:PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE|, a phosphatidyl phospholipase B (NTE1) which catalyzes two successive deacylations at both sn-2 and sn-1 of |FRAME:PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE| yielding |FRAME:L-1-GLYCERO-PHOSPHORYLCHOLINE| and the concomitant release of 2 fatty acids |CITS:[15044461] [15611060]| and a glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase (GDE1) catalyzing the cleavage of |FRAME:L-1-GLYCERO-PHOSPHORYLCHOLINE| releasing |FRAME:CHOLINE| and |FRAME:GLYCEROL-3P| in the process |CITS:[16141200]|. |FRAME:CHOLINE| can be reintroduced to the CDP-choline pathway and used to regenerate |FRAME:PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE|. 
/
/It is remarkable that NTE1p specifically accepts only |FRAME:PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE| which has been generated through the CDP-choline pathway. NTE1p is also the only phospholipase producing intracellular |FRAME:L-1-GLYCERO-PHOSPHORYLCHOLINE| |CITS:[16781190]| and interacts with SEC14, an essential protein for phosphatidylinositol (PI)/phosphatidylcholine (PC) traffic, in regulating the phosphatidylcholine flux in the cell |CITS:[15044461] [15611060] [9252414]|. There are two types of phospholipases in yeast which can metabolize |FRAME:PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE|, the phospholipase D |CITS:[9642212]| and the phospholipase B encoded by NTE1 |CITS: [15044461]|. The product of the NTE1p catalysis, i.e. |FRAME:L-1-GLYCERO-PHOSPHORYLCHOLINE|  is the substrate for the glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase encoded by GDE1 |CITS:[16141200]| which catalyzes the last step in this resynthesis cycle of |FRAME:PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE|. The gene GDE1 has been associated with EC 3.1.4.46 but EC 3.1.4.2 also shows the catalysis of |FRAME:L-1-GLYCERO-PHOSPHORYLCHOLINE| to |FRAME:CHOLINE|. Both designations have been approved by authors working on this enzyme (personal communication Christopher McMaster, September 2013). Both enzymes have not been purified to homogeneity but their molecular functions have been validated by null mutations of the respective genes.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Although the jury is still out as to whether Napoleon Bonaparte died of arsenic poisoning or cancer |CITS: [367316]
/[6750413]|, it is agreed by all that arsenic is a potent toxicant. Indeed, the results of exposure to high arsenic concentration in drinking water in West Bengal, India, and Bangladesh are considered by some to be the worst public health disasters in recent history |CITS: [15276412]|.
/The form of arsenic influences the type and severity of toxicity. |FRAME: ARSENATE Arsenate| (As<sup>V</sup>) is a structural analog of phosphate, and inhibits phosphorylation processes. For example, ADP-arsenate spontaneously hydrolyzes, resulting in uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation |CITS: [518594]|, while |FRAME: CPD-763| (As<sup>III</sup>) has a very high affinity for thiol groups, and thus binds to and inhibits many key enzymes that have thiol groups in their active sites. In addition, inorganic arsenic is a potent carcinogen |CITS: [12505313]|.
/
/|FRAME: ARSENATE Arsenate| enters the cell via the phosphate transport systems, such as the |FRAME:TAX-562| |FRAME: PITA-MONOMER| and |FRAME: ABC-27-CPLX "Pst"| systems. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes reduce intracellular |FRAME: ARSENATE| to |FRAME: CPD-763|. However, whereas prokaryotes can pump |FRAME: CPD-763| out of the cell by using a dedicated pump, multicellular organisms require other means of getting rid of the metal. Certain mammals, including humans, continue by methylating the |FRAME: CPD-763| to several methylated forms. Those are oxidized non-enzymatically to methylated As(V) forms that are considerably less toxic, and are excreted from the organism in the urine (see |FRAME: PWY-4202|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Most microorganisms are able to detoxify arsenic species by pumping them out of the cell. This cytoplasmic detoxification system involves the <i>arsC</i>-encoded cytoplasmic arsenate reductase, which reduces |FRAME: ARSENATE| to |FRAME: CPD-763|, and an efficient arsenite efflux pump consisting of a two-component ATPase complex. e |CITS: [12165430]|.
/
/ArsC cytoplasmic arsenate reductases are found widely in microbes |CITS: [15691908]|. Several different clades of microbial ArsC proteins have been described. Some share no sequence similarity, indicating parallel evolution.
/
/The eukaryotic |FRAME: CPLX-6362| of |FRAME: TAX-4932| is glutaredoxin- and glutathione-dependent, just like ArsC enzymes of Gram-negative bacteria, even though it shares no sequence homology with them. The yeast gene is named |FRAME: G3O-34320| rather than arsC.
/
/Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two independent transport systems for the removal of |FRAME: CPD-763| from the cytosol. |FRAME: G3O-34321| is a plasma membrane transporter that confers resistance to arsenite, presumably by arsenite extrusion from the cells. |FRAME: G3O-29733|, a member of the ABC transporter superfamily, catalyzes the ATP-driven uptake of As(III) into the vacuole, also producing resistance to arsenite. Vacuolar accumulation requires a reductant such as glutathione, suggesting that the substrate is the glutathione conjugate, |FRAME: CPD-22658| |CITS: [10220408]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: GERANYL-PP Geranyl diphossphate| (geranyl pyrophosphate, GPP) is the universal precursor of several classes of compounds, including the monoterpenes, a diverse group of compounds crucial for numerous biological roles. In plants monoterpenes are involved in defense against herbivores and pathogens, allelopathic interactions and pollination.
/
/Monoterpenes are also amongst the most important constituents of flavorings and fragrances for human consumption and can serve as therapeutic agents in human medicine (for review see |CITS:[11069698]|). GPP is produced by geranyl pyrophosphate synthases which catalyze the condensation of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (isopentenyl pyrophosphate, IPP) with |FRAME: CPD-4211| (DMAPP) following a head-to-tail mechanism.

COMMENT - Methylglyoxal is toxic compound that is formed as a by-product of glycolysis from triose phosphates through the action of triose-phosphate
/isomerase. One route by which methylglyoxal can be catabolized is a glyoxalase system in which methylglyoxal is condensed with glutathione to
/give S-D-lactoylglutathione by the action of glyoxalase I (GLO1) |CITS: [8824231]|, and the glutathione thiolester is then hydrolyzed to lactic acid and glutathione
/by glyoxalase II (GLO2 and GLO4) |CITS: [9261170]|. The GLO2 gene is expressed on both glucose and glycerol and the active Glo2p protein is localized in the
/cytoplasm. The GLO4 gene is only active on glycerol and the active Glo4p is localized in the mitochondrial matrix |CITS: [9261170]|. Deletion of either GLO1 or GLO2
/and GLO4 results in increased sensitivity to exogenous methylglyoxal |CITS: [8824231]||CITS: [9261170]|.

COMMENT - The tripeptide glutathione (GSH: L-&gamma;-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) is a prevalent intracellular thiol that is able to act as a cellular redox buffer due to its low redox potential (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|). GSH is involved in many biological processes including: protein and DNA synthesis; amino acid transport; enzyme regulation; protection of cells against reactive oxygen compounds and free radicals, xenobiotics and heavy metals (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|). GSH can also be used as a source of sulfur and cysteine in |CITS: [1674526], [10514563]|.
/
/GSH is synthesized from its constituent amino acids by two ATP-dependent steps (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|). In the first step &gamma;-glutamylcysteine synthetase (Gsh1p) catalyzes the formation of the dipeptide &gamma;-glutamylcysteine from glutamate and cysteine. In the second step, GSH synthetase (Gsh2p) catalyzes the ligation of glycine with &gamma;-glutamylcysteine to form GSH. GSH is an essential reductant in yeast during normal metabolic processes |CITS: [8662189]|, but the dipeptide &gamma;-glutamylcysteine is able to substitute for GSH as an antioxidant |CITS: [9307967]|.
/
/GSH biosynthesis is co-regulated by Met4p, a transcription factor that induces expression of genes involved in sulfur assimilation, by Yap1p, a stress-responsive transcription factor, and by GSH feedback inhibition, which inhibits both GSH1 expression and Gsh1p enzyme activity |CITS: [12406228], [14514673]|.  Expression of GSH1 and GSH2 is induced by oxidative stress in a Yap1p-dependent manner with subsequent increases in intracellular GSH content |CITS: [7915005], [10809786]|.  GSH1 is also transcriptionally up-regulated by the heavy metal cadmium in the presence of Met4p and the DNA-binding proteins Met31p and Met32p |CITS: [9044254], [10921921]|.

COMMENT - The tripeptide glutathione (GSH: L-&gamma;-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) is a prevalent intracellular thiol that is able to act as a cellular redox buffer due to its low redox potential (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|). GSH is involved in many biological processes including: protein and DNA synthesis; amino acid transport; enzyme regulation; protection of cells against reactive oxygen compounds and free radicals, xenobiotics and heavy metals (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|). GSH can also be used as a source of sulfur and cysteine in |CITS: [1674526], [10514563]|.
/
/Plants and animals metabolize GSH via the &gamma;-glutamyl cycle.  Whether or not this complete cycle exists in yeast and other microorganisms is open to debate |CITS: [5076], [JASPERS85]|. The two enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of GSH from its constituent amino acids, &gamma;-glutamylcysteine synthetase (Gsh1p) and GSH synthetase (Gsh2p), are present in yeast (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|).  Yeast was also found to have &gamma;-glutamyl transpeptidase (Ecm38p) and cysteinylglycine dipeptidase (CGase) |CITS: [JASPERS85]|, two vacuolar-membrane-bound enzymes that are proposed to catalyze the complete hydrolysis of GSH to its constitutive amino acids |CITS: [6143574], [11672438]|. Although enzymatic activity for CGase was observed in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> |CITS: [JASPERS85]|, the open reading frame for CGase has yet to be identified in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. The presence of the remaining two &gamma;-glutamyl cycle enzymes, &gamma;-glutamyl cyclotransferase and 5-oxoprolinase, is still in question |CITS: [5076], [JASPERS85]|, suggesting that yeast may only have a truncated &gamma;-glutamyl cycle.
/
/<i>S. cerevisiae</i> also has been proposed to have an alternative pathway for degrading GSH that involves a novel GSH degradosomal protein complex comprised of the three gene products Dug1p, Dug2p, and Dug3p |CITS: [17179087]|.

COMMENT - The glutathione/glutaredoxin and thioredoxin systems help maintain the reduced environment of the cell and play a significant role in defending the cell against oxidative stress.  They also have been proposed to play a role in DNA synthesis, protein folding and regulation, and sulfur metabolism |CITS:[11169096],[2668278]|.
/
/Glutaredoxins and thioredoxins are small heat-stable proteins that can reduce disulfides by way of conserved cysteines. Glutaredoxins catalyze reductions of intracellular disulfides or glutathione-mixed disulfides in a coupled system with glutathione, NADPH and glutathione reductase.  Unlike the thioredoxin system where oxidized thioredoxin disulfide is reduced directly by thioredoxin reductase with electrons from NADPH, oxidized glutaredoxin is reduced by glutathione with electrons donated by NADPH |CITS:[2668278]|.
/
/Yeast, similar to bacteria, plants, and humans have monothiol and dithiol glutaredoxins with the conserved active site motif Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys and Cys-Gly-Phe-Ser, respectively |CITS:[11898418]|. Monothiol glutaredoxins (Grx-SH) catalyze the reduction of thiol-glutathione mixed disulfides (Protein-S-S-G) only,
/while dithiol glutaredoxins (Grx-(SH)<sub>2</sub>) reduce both protein disulfides (Protein-S<sub>2</sub>) and GSH-mixed disulfides (Protein-S-S-G) |CITS:[11898418]|.
/
/Five glutaredoxins have been identified in S. cerevisiae, two dithiol glutaredoxins, Grx1p and Grx2p, and three monothiol glutaredoxins, Grx3p, Grx4p, and Grx5p |CITS:[11898418]|. All five glutaredoxins participate in the response against oxidative stress |CITS:[9571241][10567543]|.  GRX1 and GRX2 mutants are sensitive to
/ the oxidants superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide respectively, suggesting that they have different roles in protecting the cells |CITS:[9571241]|. The defensive roles of Grx1p and Grx2p may overlap with those of the cytosolic thioredoxins, Trx1p and Trx2p as at least one Grx1p/Grx2p glutaredoxin or one Trx1p/Trx2p thioredoxin
/ is required for yeast cell viability |CITS:[10844700]|. Although GRX3 and GRX4 mutants do not have strong sensitivity to oxidants, mutants lacking GRX5 do. GRX5 mutants also have increased protein oxidative damage, growth defects in minimal medium, and inability for respiratory growth |CITS:[10567543]|.  Grx5p has also been found
/ to be a mitochondrial glutaredoxin required for the activity of iron/sulfur enzymes |CITS:[11950925]|.

COMMENT - The thioredoxin and glutathione/glutaredoxin systems help maintain the reduced environment of the cell and play a significant role in defending the cell against oxidative stress.  They also have been proposed to play a role in the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines as required for DNA synthesis, protein folding and regulation, and sulfur metabolism |CITS:[11169096],[2668278]|. 
/
/Thioredoxins and glutaredoxins are small heat-stable proteins with redox-active cysteines that facilitate the reduction of other proteins by catalyzing cysteine thiol-disulfide exchange reactions |CITS:[2668278]|. Thioredoxins contain two conserved cysteines that exist in either a reduced form as in thioredoxin-(SH)<sub>2</sub> or in an oxidized form as in thioredoxin-S<sub>2</sub> when they form an intramolecular disulfide bridge |CITS:[2668278]|. Thioredoxins donate electrons from their active center dithiol to protein disulfide bonds (Protein-S<sub>2</sub>) that are then reduced to dithiols (Protein-(SH)<sub>2</sub>). The resulting oxidized thioredoxin disulfide is reduced directly by thioredoxin reductase with electrons donated by NADPH |CITS:[2668278]|. Hence the thioredoxin reduction system consists of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH. Oxidized glutaredoxins, on the other hand, are reduced by the tripeptide glutathione (gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly, known as GSH) using electrons donated by NADPH |CITS:[2668278]|. Hence the glutathione/glutaredoxin system consists of glutaredoxin, glutathione, glutathione reductase and NADPH. 
/
/S. cerevisiae contains a cytoplasmic thioredoxin system comprised of the thioredoxins Trx1p and Trx2p and the thioredoxin reductase Trr1p, 
/and a complete mitochondrial thioredoxin system comprised of the thioredoxin Trx3p and the thioredoxin reductase Trr2p |CITS:[15701801]|. Evidence suggests that the cytoplasmic thioredoxin system may have overlapping function with the glutathione/glutaredoxin system |CITS:[8930901], [10844700]|.  
/The mitochondrial thioredoxin system, on the other hand, does not appear to be able to substitute for either the cytoplasmic thioredoxin or glutathione/glutaredoxin 
/systems |CITS:[10844700]|. Instead, the mitochondrial thioredoxn proteins, thioredoxin (Trx3p) and thioredoxin reductase (Trr2p) have been implicated in the defense 
/against oxidative stress generated during respiratory metabolism |CITS:[10037727]|.
/
/The two cytoplasmic thioredoxins (Trx1p and Trx2p) are believed to supply reducing equivalents to the enzymes ribonucleotide reductase 
/(Rnr1p, Rnr2p, Rnr3p, Rnr4p) and 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) reductase (Met16p) |CITS:[4392601],[5442277]|. Deletion of either
/TRX1 or TRX2 has no effect on cell growth or morphology |CITS:[2026619]|, but, deletion of both genes affects the cell cycle, and makes the
/cells auxotrophic for methionine/cysteine |CITS:[2026619],[7929110]|.  Deletion of the single gene TRX2 does result in extreme sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
/and is thereby believed to be involved in the response against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> |CITS:[8313910]|. The expression of TRX2 and TRR1 are regulated by
/the transcription factors Yap1p and Skn7p in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> |CITS:[8313910],[9118942]|.

COMMENT - The glyoxylate cycle, also called the glyoxylate shunt, is present in fungi, plants, and bacteria, but not in
/ mammals. The cycle is essential for growth on two-carbon compounds such as ethanol and acetate, and
/ plays an anaplerotic role in the provision of precursors for biosynthesis.  The glyoxylate cycle is
/ comprised of many of the same reactions as the TCA cycle, but it does not include the two
/ decarboxylation reactions.  As a result, two-carbon substrates, which enter the cycle as acetyl-CoA, 
/can be converted to four-carbon compounds, which in turn can be further metabolized to create sugars and other essential
/ organic compounds. 
/
/Although several of the reactions of the glyoxylate and TCA cycle are identical, many of them are
/ catalyzed by different isozymes in different cellular compartments. The glyoxylate cycle occurs in the
/ peroxisome and cytoplasm, while the TCA cycle occurs in the mitochondria. Utilization of two-carbon
/ compounds by yeast also requires the TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis, which are coordinately regulated
/ with the glyoxylate cycle.  The succinate provided by the glyoxylate cycle enters the TCA cycle where it
/ is converted to malate; malate then reenters the cytoplasm where it is converted to oxaloacetate and
/ eventually to glucose via gluconeogenesis.
/
/The key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, as well as malate
/dehydrogenase, are regulated in yeast in response to the carbon source of the growth medium. Synthesis of these enzymes is repressed in cells grown on glucose and derepressed in media lacking
/glucose (as reported in |CITS:[5345986]|.
/
/Although S. cerevisiae is rarely found in human hosts, phagocytosis of S. cerevisiae by mammalian
/macrophages results in the induction of genes encoding glyoxylate cycle enzymes; this is thought to be
/a response to the nutrient-poor environment of the phagolysosome |CITS:[12455685][11452311]|.

COMMON-NAME - folate polyglutamylation
CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3766515103:caspi
COMMENT - Folates are required in a variety of reactions (known as one-carbon metabolism) in both bacterial and
/mammalian tissues, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states.
/These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine,
/formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme
/|FRAME:DIHYDROFOLATESYNTH-ENZRXN| (encoded in |FRAME:TAX-562| by |FRAME:EG10327|) adds a glutamate
/residue to 7,8-dihydropteroate, resulting in 7,8-dihydrofolate, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>.
/This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:DIHYDROFOLATEREDUCT-ENZRXN|
/(FolA) to tetrahydrofolate (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or THF).
/THF can then be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming
/folate polyglutamtes (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates).  Most of the glutamates are added by
/&gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate
/or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by
/peptidases or proteases that are specific for  &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide  bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized
/dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/Apparently, the glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell,
/it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in
/mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis
/|CITS: [10598551]|.
/Folylpolyglutamates are generally better substrates for folate-dependent enzymes than their monoglutamyl
/counterparts. Km values decrease with increasing oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl chain length |CITS: [2688305]|.
/At least in one case, the vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-independent methionine synthetase, there is an absolute
/requirement for the polyglutamate cofactor |CITS: [2985605]|.
/
/In addition, many folate enzymes are multifunctional and channel one-carbon units between reactions without
/achieving equilibrium with the cell medium. Therefore, the conjugated oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl chain
/can potentially regulate the reaction rates, and allows channeling of the substrate between enzymes in a way which
/controls biosynthetic pathways |CITS: [2688305]|.
/
/
/Folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamate synthetase (FPGS), the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of folates to
/polyglutamates, has been purified from several organisms, including |FRAME:TAX-562| |CITS: [2985605]|.
/It is a MgATP-dependent enzyme present in all cells. FPGS forms a complex with MgATP, a folate derivative,
/and glutamate, in an ordered manner whereby the three substrates are added sequentially |CITS: [11501996]|.
/In |FRAME:TAX-562|, FPGS is a bi-functional enzyme, which also catalyzes the addition of glutamate
/to 7,8-dihydropteroate, generating 7,8,-dihydrofolate (dihydrofolate synthetase, (E.C# 6.3.2.12).
/
/In exponentially growing cells of |FRAME:TAX-562| folylpoly-&gamma;- glutamates have short glutamate chain lengths:
/mono- and triglutamate derivatives are most abundant, with tetra-, penta- and hexaglutamate derivatives
/also present (in order of decreasing abundance). However, in stationary phase, cells contain longer-chain-length
/folypolyglutamates, with the predominant chain length containing six or seven  glutamyl residues.
/These longer chains are generated by a second enzyme, which adds glutamate moieties in &alpha;-linkage to
/tetrahydropteroyl- triglutamates |CITS: [3536926]|. However, this enzyme has not been purified,
/nor has the gene encoding it been identified. 
/
/Both folylpolyglutamate synthetases can accept several different folate derivatives as substrates. It seems that
/the preferred substrate for the addition of a second glutamate residue is 10-formyl-THF
/(10-formyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>), while the preferred substrate for the addition of a third glutamate
/residue is the glutamated form of 5,10-methylene-THF (5,10-methylene-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>2</sub>).

COMMENT - Triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism in yeast is realized by a number of anabolic and catabolic pathways which include the esterification and re-esterification of the various intermediates such a mono- and diacylglycerols.  The enzymes involved in the metabolism of acylglycerols and glycerolipids in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> have been shown to be associated with membranous organelles, particularly the endoplasmatic reticulum and lipid droplets and shown to be conserved between yeast and mammals |CITS:[22345606]|. The conversion of monoacylglycerols to diacylglycerols or other precursors for glycerophospholipids may utilize different paths and contribute significantly to the regulation of triacylglycerol homeostasis during the different developmental phases of growth in yeast |CITS:[20231294]|. Although it has been shown that the biosynthesis of storage lipids such as steryl esters and triacylglycerol (TAG) is non-essential in yeast it may positively influence the long term survival under certain stress conditions such as nitrogen starvation |CITS:[11741946]|.
/
/The pathway depicted here exemplifies the various metabolic possibilities monoacylglycerols have in the biochemical scheme of TAG and phospholipid catabolic and anabolic processes. The only monoacylglycerol lipase in yeast, i.e. YUJ3p was shown to accept both |FRAME:CPD-11690| and |FRAME:CPD0-1812| as substrates indicating that the spontaneous racemization of the sn-2 to the sn-1 (or sn-3) position (see |FRAME:LIPAS-PWY|) is not a necessity for enzymatic activity |CITS:[10515935] [20554061]|. The buildup of diacylglycerols from monoacylglycerols has been demonstrated by the bifunctional acyl-CoA: acylglycerol acyltransferase (DGA1). While DGA1p is the only acyl-CoA dependent diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) in TAG formation |CITS:[11751830]| the enzyme also acts as acyl-CoA dependent monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) |CITS:[20554061]|. In addition, the acyl-CoA independent phospholipid: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT) in yeast encoded by LRO1 |CITS:[10829075]| had been reported to utilize monoacylglycerols as well, hence may be involved in the formation of DAG as an gateway compound to the biosynthesis of phosphoglycerides |CITS:[18037386]|. Finally, the CTP dependent diacylglycerol kinase encoded by DGK1 |CITS:[18458076]| is suspected to convert monoacylglycerols into lysophospholipids which may be discharged into phosphatidate and phospholipid metabolic pathways (see for example |FRAME:PWY-7411|, |FRAME:PWY-7417|) |CITS:[20554061]|.

COMMENT - The homeostasis of glycerophospholipids constitutes an indispensable element for buildup, maintenance and component dynamics of cell membranes in all organisms. The many different phospholipid molecular species found in yeast basically vary in their composition of fatty acids esterified to the sn-1 and sn-2 position of a phosphorylated |FRAME:GLYCEROL| and a head group which can either be a |FRAME:CHOLINE|, |FRAME:ETHANOL-AMINE|, |FRAME:SER|, |FRAME:MYO-INOSITOL| or the one phospholipid without a head group, i.e. phosphatidate (for example |FRAME:CPD-8291|) |CITS:[14321173] [22345606]|. After the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of phospholipids in the Kennedy pathway (see |FRAME:TRIGLSYN-PWY|, |FRAME:PWY3O-450|) glycerophospholipids can be degraded (see |FRAME:LIPAS-PWY|, |FRAME:LIPASYN-PWY-1|) and remodeled (this pathway; see also |FRAME:PWY-7409| and |FRAME:PWY-7417|). The latter has been proposed by William E.M. Lands |CITS:[14413818]| who describes in the eponymous 'Lands cycle' a de-acylation-re-acylation process of phospholipids typically characterized by saturated acyl chains at the sn-1 and unsaturated acyl chains at the sn-2 position |CITS:[7871882]|.
/
/This remodeling process starts with the de-acylation at the sn-2 position of phospholipids catalyzed by phospholipases (e.g. phospholipase A2) generating the corresponding lyso-phospholipids. The resulting lyso-phospholipids represent the substrates for acyl-CoA dependent lyso-phospholipid acyltransferases or phospholipid transacylases which can re-acylate the sn-2 position. Generally, the Lands cycle constitutes an exchange of fatty acids at the sn-2 position which is an substantial factor in the maintenance of the homeostasis of phospholipids |CITS:[17010666]|. This de- and re-acylation process translates into many physiological functions, for example increasing membrane fluidity through a higher percentage of unsaturated acyl chains, re-esterification of exogenous lyso-phospholipids |CITS:[17726007]|, buffering excess toxic fatty acids |CITS:[22090344] [19608739]| and maintenance of the intrinsic membrane curvature necessary to preserve membrane integrity |CITS:[16339082] [31173]|.
/
/In the phosphatidylcholine remodeling pathway the de-acylation of |FRAME:1-2-DIPALMITOYLPHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE| is catalyzed by the phospholipase A2 activity of the triacylglycerol lipase TGL4p |CITS:[16135509] [16267052] [20332534]| whereas the re-acylation of |FRAME:CPD-8343| is carried out by the acyl-CoA dependent lyso-phosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (TAZ1p) |CITS:[9930410] [15588229]|. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a very dominant phospholipid species in membranes of most eukaryotic organisms |CITS:[17010666]| and as such its homeostasis must be under a very tight control to ensure the proper functioning of cell membranes |CITS:[16339082]|.

COMMENT - Triacylglycerol (TAG) is the major lipid reserve in plants and animals. The assembly of TAG occurs in 
/the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Four consecutive reactions are catalyzed by ER membrane bound 
/enzymes. The two intermediates, phosphatidate and 1,2-diacylglycerol, are also substrates for the 
/synthesis of membrane lipids glycosylglycerides and phosphoglycerides. Thus, the last step in the 
/pathway, catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase, is the only dedicated step in triacylglycerol 
/synthesis.
/
/The traditional Kennedy pathway does not include the reaction (EC 2.3.1.158, phospholipid:diacylglycerol 
/acyltransferase, PDAT) where phospholipid is 
/utilized as the acyl donor in TAG formation. The role of the PDAT route in TAG 
/biosynthesis was clearly shown in yeast |CITS: [10829075]|. PDAT activity in plants was demonstrated 
/in a few oil seed plants including
/caster bean |CITS: [10829075]|. The caster bean seeds have a high content of
/ricinoleat in the seed oil. Ricinoleat and other unusual fatty acids are
/modified from acyl groups linked to phospholipids, and transferred to
/TAG afterwards. PDAT was proposed playing an important role in
/the last step. However, the contribution of PDAT to TAG biosynthesis in other
/plants is not clear. Overexpressing or knockout of the Arabidopsis PDAT had
/no effect on TAG biosynthesis |CITS: [15247387][15907694]|. 
/
/The well-coordinated regulation of lipid homeostasis in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is exemplified by the cooperation of two enzymes operating through catabolic and anabolic steps of triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism. The formation of diacylglycerol, a precursor for TAG and phospholipid biosynthesis, is catalyzed both by the triacylglycerol lipase TGL4 |CITS:[16135509]| and phosphatidate phosphatase PAH1 |CITS:[2542283]|, the former catalyzing the degradation of TAG and the latter forming DAG by dephosphorylation of phosphatidate (PA). Both enzymes are controlled in their activity by Cdk1/Cdc28-dependent phosphorylation, with TGL4 being phosphorylated (activated) and PAH1 being phosphorylated (deactivated) at different times in the cell cycle |CITS:[19150427]|. The interaction of two enzymes involved in different metabolic events of TAG metabolism which are controlled by the same cyclin-dependent kinase ensures a steady and regulated flow of precursors for membrane phospholipid synthesis highlighting the importance of TAG homeostasis in the critical phase of cell growth in yeast |CITS:[22910056]|. 
/
/
/A third route forming TAG may also exist. Diacylglycerol transacylase activity was detected in plant |CITS: [Stobart97]| as well as in animal |CITS: [8473321]|. It catalyzes the formation of one molecule TAG and one molecule monoacylglycerol from two molecules of diacylglycerol. 
/
/The constitution of different species of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids at the sn-1, sn-2, and 
/sn-3 positions of the glycerol backbone varies among different plants, and is determined by substrate 
/specificities of the three acyltransferases involved in this pathway. The composition of distinct fatty acids 
/in TAG determines the quality and property of lipids of different plants, and also contributes to cold 
/temperature sensitivity of different plants.

TYPES - Fatty-Acid-Biosyn-Initiation
COMMON-NAME - fatty acid biosynthesis initiation (mitochondria)
CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3797277232:caspi
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Fatty-Acids "Fatty acids"| are key building blocks for the phospholipid components of cell membranes. They are also determinants of intracellular communication in the form of lipid second messengers |CITS: [11094259]| and fatty acyl moieties of proteins that modify their location and function |CITS: [10446384]|.
/
/There are two basic types of fatty acid biosynthesis systems, named type I and type II.
/Type I systems are found in lower eukaryotes and animals, while type II systems are found in bacteria, plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the |FRAME: TAX-5794| phylum |CITS: [17112527]| and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|. Thus both systems operate in animals - the type I system in the cytosol, (see |FRAME: PWY-5994|), and the type II system in the mitochondria (this pathway).
/
/The main difference between the two systems is that type I systems consist of one (in the case of animals) or two (in the case of fungi) large multifunctional gene products that form a single complex that contains all of the reaction centers required to produce a fatty acid (see |FRAME: CPLX-7628| from |FRAME: TAX-9606|), while in type II systems the different reactions are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as thioesters of |FRAME: ACP|.
/
/Fatty acid biosynthesis starts with an initiation sequence that produces |FRAME: Acetoacetyl-ACPs|, an activated molecule that is used for subsequent elongation reactions, which ultimately produce the final fatty acid products. This pathway describes only the initiation sequence that occurs in the mitochondria.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The first committed and rate-limiting step in <i>de novo</i> fatty acid biosynthesis is the carboxylation of |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| to |FRAME: MALONYL-COA|, which is catalyzed in mammals by the two isoforms of |FRAME: EC-6.4.1.2|, encoded by the |FRAME: HS05598| and |FRAME: HS01211| genes. These enzymes are dimeric, multifunctional enzymes composed of four distinct domains; a biotin carboxylase (BC) domain, a biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain, the ACC central region, and a carboxyltransferase (CT) domain. The malonyl moiety of malonyl-CoA is then transferred to the mitochondrial acyl-carrier protein by |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.39|, encoded by the |FRAME: HS02028| gene |CITS: [12882974]|.
/
/As the two ACC enzymes are considered to be cytosolic, it is not clear how they contribute to fatty acid biosynthesis initiation inside the mitochondria. It has been shown that |FRAME: HS01211| is attached to the mitochondrial membrane facing the cytoplasm, and is thus unlikely to contribute to this pathway. It has been proposed that |FRAME: HS05598| fulfills this role in the mitochondrial FAS system. In addition, it is possible that |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| is imported from the cytosol into the mitichondrion matrix.
/
/The initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis requires an acetyl primer. In type I systems the acetyl group is attached to the fatty acid synthase without a need for additional enzymes. Type II systems of bacteria and plants usually require a specialized enzyme (called &beta;-ketoacyl synthase III in prokaryotes and chloroplasts) that accepts |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| as the primer. However, such an enzyme has not been identified in mitochondria, and the only mitochondrial &beta;-ketoacyl synthase, which is encoded by the |FRAME: HS07707| gene, can only accept the acetyl primer from |FRAME: ACETYL-ACP "acetyl-[acp]"|. It has not been reported which enzyme is responsible for the acetylation of the acp protein.
/
/|FRAME: MALONYL-ACP "Malonyl-[acp]"| is used as the extender unit throughout the process of mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PWY66-430|), with the malonyl moiety transferred to acyl-[acp] acceptors of varying lentghs. During the initiation process the malonyl group is transferred to the acetyl group primer via a decarboxylative condensation reaction. The product, |FRAME: 3-KETOBUTYRATE|, marks the end of the fatty acid biosynthesis initiation process. It is subsequently extended by several cycles of the fatty acid synthase, as described in |FRAME: PWY-7388|.

TYPES - Protein-Modification
COMMON-NAME - protein NEDDylation
CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3797277232:caspi
COMMENT - This pathway describes the process of protein NEDDylation, and refers to the mammaliam NEDD8 protein. The yeast counterpart is the |FRAME: G3O-29736| protein.
/
/|FRAME: NEDD8 "NEDD8 proteins"| (neural-precursor-cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 8) are small |FRAME: Ubiquitins ubiquitin|-like proteins that are covalently conjugated to a limited number of cellular proteins in a manner analogous to |FRAME: PWY-7511 ubiquitination|. The attachment of NEDD8 to proteins is known as neddylation.
/
/Like ubiquitin, the NEDD8 proteins end with two glycine residues. |FRAME: NEDD8-activating-proteins-E1 "An [E1 NEDD8-activating enzyme]"|, which is a heterodimer composed of |FRAME: HS08411| and |FRAME: HS07200| subunits, activates NEDD8 in an ATP-dependent reaction by forming a high-energy thioester intermediate between NEDD8 and one of its cysteine residues |CITS: [14690597]|. The activated NEDD8 is subsequently transferred to a cysteine residue of |FRAME: NEDD8-carrier-proteins-E2| (such as the human |FRAME: HS05432| and UBE2F |CITS: [19250909]|), and is eventually conjugated to a lysine residue of specific substrates in the presence of the appropriate E3 transferase |CITS: [9694792][10207026]|.
/
/The primary known substrates of NEDD8 modification are the |FRAME: Cullins cullin| subunits of some forms of |FRAME: EC-2.3.2.27| that are not able to bind a protein substrate directly. These E3 proteins form a complex with a cullin protein and a substrate recognition subunit (SRS), and often include an adaptor that links the SRS to the complex. The complexes are known as CRLs for Cullin-RING ubiquitin Ligases (although technically they are not ligases). Within the CRL complexes, the |FRAME: Cullins cullin| protein serves as a scaffold that connects the E3 trransferase and the adapter/substrate-binding protein sub-complex |CITS: [15688063]|. However, the complex is not active until a conserved lysine residue of the cullin protein is neddylated |CITS: [10781063][10713156][15021886]|.
/
/CRLs comprise the largest known category of ubiquitin ligases, and regulate an extensive number of dynamic cellular processes, including multiple aspects of the cell cycle, transcription, signal transduction, and development |CITS: [18282298]|. By controling the activity of the CRLs, neddylation helps regulate these processes.
/
/In the absence of NEDD8, the cullin protein binds the CAND1 protein, which prevents the cullin from binding the |FRAME: HS03694| adapter protein and form a functional complex |CITS: [12504026][15537541]|. The binding of NEDD8 to a C-terminal lysine residue results in a conformation change, dissociating CAND1 and enabling the formation of an active complex |CITS: [12504025]|.
/
/
/Several proteases, including the human UCHL1, UCHL3, USP21, COP9 , and NEDP1 proteins, can remove NEDD8 from its protein conjugates.

COMMON-NAME - L-phenylalanine biosynthesis I
CITATIONS - 1943992:EV-EXP-TAS:3731260800:caspi
COMMENT - Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan proceeds via a common pathway to chorismate, at which point the pathway branches |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  One branch proceeds to phenylalanine and tyrosine, and the other to tryptophan |CITS:[Jones]|. The phenylalanine and tyrosine branch has one reaction in common, rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate, at which point, the pathway branches again to either phenylalanine or tyrosine |CITS:[1943992]|). S. cerevisiae, similar to E. coli, synthesize phenylalanine and tyrosine via the intermediate 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and phenylpyruvate, respectively, while some other organisms synthesize them via arogenate |CITS:[1943992]|.
/
/Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition, activation of enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The carbon flow through the pathways is regulated primarily at the initial step and the branching points by the terminal end-products. The initial step of chorismate biosynthesis can be catalyzed by two isoenzymes Aro3p or Aro4p, whereby Aro3p is inhibited by phenylalanine, and Aro4p by tyrosine |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The first step in the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine and activated by tryptophan |CITS:[1943992]|.  The transcriptional activator GCN4 regulates most of the genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes; however, no GCN4 regulation was found for ARO7 of the phenylalanine and tyrosine and branch, TYR1 of the tyrosine branch, or TRP1 of the tryptophan branch |CITS:[1943992]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of several important metabolites involves the consumption of |FRAME: MET| through the utilization of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM), in a reaction that releases |FRAME:5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA). 
/These metabilites include polyamines (see |FRAME: ARGSPECAT-PWY|, |FRAME:BSUBPOLYAMSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY0-1303|), |FRAME: ETHYLENE-CMPD| (see |FRAME: ETHYL-PWY|), and bacterial auto-inducers (see |FRAME: PWY-6157|).
/
/MTA is a strong inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions, and its concentration is tightly regulated. Several pathways that recycle MTA back to |FRAME: MET| have been described.
/
/The pathway shown here, also known as the universal methionine salvage pathway, is present with some variations in almost all eukaryotes and some bacteria |CITS: [19946895]|. It has been partially characterized from a number of organisms, including bacteria |CITS:[8227039][7852397][8694776][9880484][11371200]|, plants |CITS: [Baur72][Murr75][Kushad83][Miyazaki87]|, yeast |CITS: [3906034]|, protozoal parasites |CITS: [8585735][ 11443076]| and rat |CITS: [7007366][7068632][7852397]|. The pathway was best studied in the Gram-negative bacterium |FRAME: TAX-573|.
/
/A limiting factor to the distribution of this pathway is that it contains an oxygen-requiring step (|FRAME: EC-1.13.11.54|), and is thus present only in aerobic organisms. Alternative pathways exist in anaerobic organisms and are described in |FRAME: PWY-7174| and |FRAME: PWY-8132|.
/
/While most of the pathway is conserved among the different organisms that possess it, several variants exist that differ in the initial steps of the pathway, between |FRAME: 5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA) and |FRAME: CPD-1063| (MTRP). These variants, describing bacteria and plants, higher eukaryotes, and protozoa, are described by several pathways under |FRAME: Methylthioadenosine-Degradation|. The metabolic differences in the early steps of the methionine salvage pathway are being exploited for developing new drugs targeted against pathogenic microorganisms that utilize the MTA nucleosidase-MTR kinase pathway |CITS: [2854458][2153115][1929327]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway describes the conserved part of the methionine salvage cycle, starting with |FRAME: CPD-444|. In 6 steps, comprising an isomerase, a dehydratase, an enolase, a phosphatase, an oxygenase, and a transaminase, |FRAME: CPD-444| is converted to |FRAME: MET| |CITS: [19946895]|. The last enzyme, a glutamine-dependent transaminase, produces the byproduct |FRAME: 2-KETO-GLUTARAMATE|, which is believed to be toxic. Thus an additional enzyme, an &omega;-amidase that converts the latter to |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|, is also considered a part of the pathway |CITS: [24837359]|.
/
/<b>A few notes of interest about the enzymes of this pathway</b>
/
/At least in some strains, such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|, |FRAME: EC-5.3.2.5|, is a member of the RubisCO protein family |CITS: [17352497]|.
/
/The reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-1.13.11.54|, can occur non-enzymatically in the presence of air |CITS: [7852397]|. It is yet unknown whether the non-enzymatic reaction occurs <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [7852397]|.
/
/If the enzyme that usually catalyzes |FRAME: EC-1.13.11.54| binds a Ni<sup>2+</sup> instead of Fe<sup>2+</sup>, it catalyzes a different reaction (|FRAME: EC-1.13.11.53|), forming a shunt of the methionine salvage pathway (see |FRAME:PWY-5389|) |CITS: [11371200][9880484][7852397]|. The purpose of this off-pathway reaction is yet unknown; it may, however, provide a mechanism for regulating |FRAME: MET| levels <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [11371200]|.
/
/In some organisms the reactions catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-5.3.2.5| and |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.87| are catalyzed by a single enzyme, |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.77| (MtnC).

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>
/
/In contrast to mammals where peroxisomal and mitochondrial pathways of oxidative fatty acid degradation exist the fatty acid &beta;-oxidation in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is exclusively carried out in peroxisomes. Fatty acid &beta;-oxidation is a crucial component in a process that supplies energy to the cell for maintenance and growth and as such has been thoroughly investigated for a long time |CITS:[8685242]|.
/
/<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is able to grow on various carbon sources including fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids or fatty acids with <i>trans</i>-double bonds at even-numbered positions can be completely degraded in the &beta;-oxidation cycle (this pathway).  The &beta;-oxidation of fatty acids is a straightforward process which requires the participation of three enzymes, i.e. acyl-CoA oxidase (POX1), the multifunctional hydratase/dehydrogenase (FOX2) and the thiolase (POT1). At the end of the process stands a saturated fatty acid shortened by 2 carbon units (|FRAME:ACETYL-COA|) which is further metabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (see |FRAME:PWY-5690|) |CITS:[12697341]|.  However, unsaturated fatty acids with <i>cis</i>- or <i>trans</i>-double bonds at odd-numbered positions or <i>cis</i>-double bonds at even-numbered positions entails the involvement of so-called auxiliary enzymes (see |FRAME:PWY-7291|, |FRAME:PWY-7292| and |FRAME:PWY-7307|). 
/
/Besides the location and certain biochemical differences &beta;-oxidation of fatty acids in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is distinguished by the stereo-specificity of their multifunctional enzyme/protein (MFE/P) from other organisms. While yeast exclusively employs the enzyme catalyzing the (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA variety, plants have a pronounced S stereo-specificity (see |FRAME:PWY-5136|) and animals can both utilize S- and R-stereo-specific compounds (see |FRAME:PWY66-391|) |CITS:[17028011]|.  It has been proposed that the evolutionary development of the 3R-variant of the yeast pathway was the result of the overall function rather than the compound stereo-specificity as the chirality of the intermediates could be changed in yeast by replacing yeast MFE with rat peroxisomal MFE which had no influence on the growth of yeast on |FRAME:OLEATE-CPD| |CITS:[7499202]|.
/  
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/Prior to the process of breaking down saturated fatty acids in the peroxisomal &beta;-oxidation cycle, fatty acids of varying length need to be transported from the cytoplasm across the peroxisomal membrane and activated by acyl-CoA synthetases/ligases. The process of how fatty acids are taken up has been a matter of debate for some time and various models from passive diffusion to vectorial acylation and a combination of both have been proposed (reviewed in |CITS:[12697341]|. Experimental evidence point out a close relationship between fatty acid transporter proteins such as the bifunctional FAT1 (long chain fatty acid transport and very long chain fatty acid activation)  |CITS:[12052836] [12601005]|, peroxisomal acyl-CoA synthases/ligases (FAA1-4) |CITS:[8206942] [7962057] [8027063]| and ABC transporter proteins such as PXA1 and 2 |CITS:[8670886]|. A current model proposes that acyl-CoA's are hydrolyzed before transported across the peroxisomal membrane, re-esterified after the entry into the peroxisomes by acyl-CoA synthases (e.g. FAA2 and possibly FAT1) in concord with the PXA1/2 complex which delivers the acyl-group from the cytoplasm to the peroxisomal matrix |CITS:[22493507]|.
/
/The first enzymatic conversion of the &beta;-oxidation cycle is catalyzed by the fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (POX1) and regarded as the rate-limiting step of the pathway |CITS:[2189786] [11431484]|. All of the enzymes involved in the peroxisomal fatty acid &beta;-oxidation are inducible by fatty acids (e.g. |FRAME:OLEATE-CPD|) which also causes increased proliferation of the peroxisomal compartment |CITS:[5325972] [3332968]|. This dual event is under the control of the transcription factors PIP2-OAF1 |CITS:[8662598] [8670793]| which have been shown to bind to the upstream activation sequence (UAS1) of the oleate response element (ORE1) responsible for activating POX1 and other fatty acid &beta;-oxidation enzymes |CITS:[8993556]|. The regulation of those enzymes also involves the transcription factor ADR1 which has been shown to act indirectly through influencing the transcription of PIP2-OAF1 |CITS:[11431484]|.
/
/The multifunctional protein type 2 (FOX2) catalyzing a hydratase and dehydrogenase reaction was shown to have a pronounced stereo-specificity towards the 3R-isomer of the hydroxyacyl-CoA |CITS:[1551874]|. The enzyme possesses two dehydrogenase domains, one responsible for catalyzing medium- and long-chain fatty acyl-CoA's whereas the second dehydrogenase domain preferred short-chain fatty acyl-CoA esters. Both dehydrogenase activities have been shown necessary for yeast growth when fatty acids were the only source of carbon |CITS:[10497229] [16574148]|.
/
/The last step in the pathway is carried out by the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (POT1) which catalyzes the thiolytic cleavage to yield a C2-shortened acyl-CoA and |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| |CITS:[7754706]|. Interestingly, the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase had also been demonstrated to exhibit antifungal activities, hence the enzyme represents an natural anti-fungicide occurring in yeast peroxisomes |CITS:[19470242]|.

COMMENT - <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is able to grow on various carbon sources including fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids or fatty acids with <i>trans</i>-double bonds at even-numbered positions can be completely degraded in the &beta;-oxidation cycle (|FRAME:PWY-7288|).  The &beta;-oxidation of saturated fatty acids is a straightforward process which requires the participation of three enzymes, i.e. acyl-CoA oxidase (POX1), the multifunctional hydratase/dehydrogenase (FOX2) and the thiolase (POT1). At the end of the process stands a saturated fatty acid shortened by 2 carbon units (|FRAME:ACETYL-COA|) which is further metabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (see |FRAME:PWY-5690|) |CITS:[12697341]|.  However, unsaturated fatty acids with <i>cis</i>- or <i>trans</i>-double bonds at odd-numbered positions or <i>cis</i>-double bonds at even-numbered positions entails the involvement of so-called auxiliary enzymes (see |FRAME:PWY-7292| and |FRAME:PWY-7307|). 
/
/The major pathway for the break-down of |FRAME:OLEATE-CPD| via &beta;-oxidation is the isomerase-dependent pathway depicted here. This pathway only requires the catalytic activity of one additionally auxiliary enzyme, i.e. &Delta;<sup>3</sup>,&Delta;<sup>2</sup>-enoyl-CoA isomerase after which the pathway has been named. After two cycles of &beta;-oxidation the double bond of |FRAME:OLEOYL-COA| is moved from &Delta;9 into the &Delta;5 position and has additionally been received a trans-double bond at position 2 by the catalytic action of |FRAME:YGL205W-MONOMER| (POX1) |CITS:[2189786] [8685242] [19830908]|. The intermediate |FRAME:CPD0-1162| goes through another cycle of &beta;-oxidation after which |FRAME:CPD-7221|is isomerized by |FRAME:CPLX-8706| to form |FRAME:CPD-7222|. The resulting |FRAME:CPD-7222| is now a proper substrate for further &beta;-oxidation in the cycle. As all the enzymes involved in fatty acid &beta;-oxidation also the auxiliary &Delta;<sup>3</sup>,&Delta;<sup>2</sup>-enoyl-CoA isomerase (ECI1) is inducible by fatty acids (e.g. |FRAME:OLEATE-CPD|) |CITS:[9837886] [9813046]| which also causes increased proliferation of the peroxisomal compartment |CITS:[5325972] [3332968]|. In addition to fatty acids with double bonds on odd-numbered positions ECI1 also is discussed as an requirement for the break-down at even-numbered double bonds of fatty acids |CITS:[9813046]|.

COMMENT - In this L-lysine degradation pathway lysine is degraded to glutarate via acetylation of the 6-amino group to the initial product |FRAME: CPD-567|. This is followed by transamination, oxidative decarboxylation, deacetylation, transamination with loss of the second amino group, and oxidation to glutarate.
/
/Evidence for this pathway was also obtained with the fungus |FRAME: TAX-1541393| and several other yeasts and fungi |CITS: [131119]|. In whole cell cultures, formation of the initial product, |FRAME: CPD-567|, was demonstrated in the fungus |FRAME:TAX-5141| 33933 and the yeasts |FRAME:TAX-4932| and |FRAME: TAX-907340|. In these experiments, whole cell cultures of |FRAME: TAX-1541393|, <i>N. crassa</i>, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>C. saturnus</i> incubated with radiolabeled L-lysine all produced labeled |FRAME: CPD-567|.
/
/Whole cell cultures of <i>N. crassa</i> 33933 and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> incubated with DL-[4,5-<sup>3</sup>H]lysine were shown to accumulate radiolabeled |FRAME: 5-ACETAMIDOVALERATE|. When <i>N. crassa</i> strains 33933 and 15069, and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> were incubated with DL-[2-<sup>14</sup>C]lysine, DL-[6-<sup>14</sup>C]lysine, or DL-[4,5-<sup>3</sup>H]lysine, radiolabeled |FRAME: 5-AMINOPENTANOATE| was shown to accumulate. Species differences in the results, depending upon the radiolabel used, may be attributable to the presence of a racemase and a deacylase in |FRAME: TAX-1541393|.  These experiments provided evidence for a generalized pathway of lysine degradation in yeasts and fungi |CITS: [131119]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Backround</b>
/
/The polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|,
/and |FRAME:SPERMINE|) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many
/biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating
/several enzymes |CITS: [3157043][4873311][1409623][2185470]|.
/While it is clear that polyamines are essential for normal cell growth, we still do not fully
/understand their specific molecular functions <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[3157043]|.
/|FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| are found in all life forms, and
/|FRAME:SPERMINE| is found mostly in eukaryotes.
/
/|FRAME:PUTRESCINE| can be formed either directly from |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| by ornithine
/decarboxylase (ODC) (see |FRAME:PWY-46|) or indirectly from |FRAME:ARG| by arginine decarboxylase
/(ADC) (see |FRAME:PWY-40| and |FRAME:PWY-43|).
/While the ODC pathway was considered the only mammalian pathway for polyamine biosynthesis,
/recently the presence of the ADC pathway in mammals has been demonstrated |CITS:[11804860]
/[14738999]|. In higher plants the presence of both pathways has been known for some time
/|CITS: [11537482]|.
/In bacteria, both pathways are common, and are often found side by side in the same organism
/|CITS:[3157043]|.
/
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In the ODC pathway |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| is generated in a single reaction from
/|FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| by the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase.
/|FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| can be decarboxylated into |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| for two purposes - either
/anabolically, for the generation of |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| as a polyamine on its own, or as a precursor
/of |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, or catabolically, as a carbon and nitrogen source. Catabolic
/|FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| degradation is illustrated in the pathway |FRAME:ORNDEG-PWY|. 
/
/Enteric bacteria possess two forms of ornithine decarboxylase, a biosynthetic
/(or constitutive) form (for example, |FRAME:ORNDECARBOX-BIO-CPLX|), apparently present in all
/strains of <i>E. coli</i>, and a biodegradative (or inducible) form
/(for example, |FRAME:ORNDECARBOXDEG-CPLX|), which is present in only some
/strains of <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [3157043] [1939141]|. Other organisms, such as |FRAME: TAX-287|
/appear to have only a single |FRAME:CPLX-25|, which is regulated in a complex manner to ensure
/proper expression for both polyamine biosynthesis and catabolism.
/
/Biosynthetic ornithine decarboxylase is inhibited by both |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and

/The degradation of the <i>cis</i>-unsaturated fatty acid |FRAME:CPD-15680|  in <i>Saccharomyces</i> (this pathway) has been investigated by monitoring the formation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (see |FRAME:PWY-6657|). The commonly used method to study the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids in yeast such as observing clearing zones around colonies growing on media which provide those fatty acids as sole carbon source has its limits in detecting certain intermediates |CITS:[11566445]|.

However, it rapidly became apparent that the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymerization method also represented a powerful tool to follow carbon fluxes, monitor substrate specificities, detect and engineer new metabolic routes and analyze quantity and quality of unusual fatty acid degradation intermediates in a variety of organisms |CITS:[9634754] [11679353] [10571864] [18657232]|.

/<b>About the pathway</b>
/
/By introducing a bacterial PHA synthase from <i>Pseudomonads</i> modified for yeast peroxisomal targeting which polymerizes the various 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA species generated in the &beta;-oxidation cycle (see |FRAME:PWY-7288|) it is now possible to determine the composition and amount of the substrates and intermediates in a range from 5 to 16 carbons in length |CITS:[16347790] [11679353]|. The degradation of |FRAME:CPD-15680| following the fatty acid activation to form the respective CoA derivative occurs in a pathway that combines auxiliary enzymes with core-enzymes of the &beta;-oxidation cycle.

COMMENT - Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan proceeds via a common pathway to chorismate, at which point the pathway branches|CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  One branch proceeds to tyrosine and phenylalanine, and the other to tryptophan |CITS:[Jones]|.  The series of reactions to chorismate, called the shikimate pathway, and the series of reactions from chorismate to tryptophan have been found to be common to all eukaryotes and prokaryotes studied thus far (as reported in |CITS:[1943992]|).  In contrast, there appears to be two separate routes for tyrosine and phenylalanine biosynthesis from chorismate, only one of which has been found in S. cerevisiae |CITS:[1943992]|.  S. cerevisiae, similar to E. coli, synthesize tyrosine and phenylalanine via the intermediate 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and phenylpyruvate, respectively, whereas some other organisms synthesize them via arogenate |CITS:[1943992]|.
/
/Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition, activation of enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The carbon flow through the pathways is regulated primarily at the initial step and the branching points by the terminal end-products. The initial step of chorismate biosynthesis can be catalyzed by two isoenzymes Aro3p or Aro4p, whereby Aro3p is inhibited by phenylalanine, and Aro4p by tyrosine |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The first step in the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine and activated by tryptophan, and the first step in the tryptophan branch is feedback inhibited by tryptophan |CITS:[1943992]|.  The transcriptional activator GCN4 regulates most of the genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes; however, no GCN4 regulation was found for TYR1 of the tyrosine branch, ARO7 of the tyrosine and phenylalanine branch or TRP1 of the tryptophan branch, |CITS:[1943992]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>
/
/<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is able to grow on various carbon sources including fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids or fatty acids with <i>trans</i>-double bonds at even-numbered positions can be completely degraded in the &beta;-oxidation cycle (|FRAME:PWY-7288|) |CITS:[12697341]|.  However, unsaturated fatty acids with <i>cis</i>- or <i>trans</i>-double bonds at odd-numbered positions or <i>cis</i>-double bonds at even-numbered positions entails the involvement of so-called auxiliary enzymes (see |FRAME:PWY-7291| and |FRAME:PWY-7292|) |CITS:[12697341] [14523547] [8685242]|.
/
/The degradation of the <i>trans</i>-unsaturated fatty acid |FRAME:CPD-15679|  in <i>Saccharomyces</i> (this pathway) has been investigated by monitoring the formation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (see |FRAME:PWY-6657|). The commonly used method to study the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids in yeast such as observing clearing zones around colonies growing on media which provide those fatty acids as sole carbon source has its limits in detecting certain intermediates |CITS:[11566445]|. The formation of polymers from polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) had been originally developed for commercial purposes by producing protein-based polymers and elastomers as part of the efforts to produce renewable and biodegradable raw materials |CITS:[10209132] [9634754]|. However, it rapidly became apparent that the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymerization method also represented a powerful tool to follow carbon fluxes, monitor substrate specificities, detect and engineer new metabolic routes and analyze quantity and quality of unusual fatty acid degradation intermediates in a variety of organisms |CITS:[9634754] [11679353] [10571864] [18657232]|. 
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>
/
/By introducing a bacterial PHA synthase from <i>Pseudomonads</i> modified for yeast peroxisomal targeting which polymerizes the various 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA species generated in the &beta;-oxidation cycle (see |FRAME:PWY-7288|) it is now possible to determine the composition and amount of the substrates and intermediates in a range from 5 to 16 carbons in length |CITS:[16347790] [11679353]|. The degradation of |FRAME:CPD-15679| following the fatty acid activation to form the respective CoA derivative occurs in two pathways which combine auxiliary enzymes with core-enzymes of the &beta;-oxidation cycle. Utilizing yeast mutants, i.e. &Delta;eci1, &Delta;sps19 and &Delta;dci1 and evaluating the quantity and monomer composition of the synthesized PHA the pathway sequences degrading |FRAME:CPD-15679| could be determined |CITS:[15904873]|. As mentioned above the degradation of |FRAME:CPD-15679| could only be monitored via PHA polymerization to the formation of |FRAME:CPD-15660| as this is the detection limit of the method |CITS:[16347790]|.  
/
/Whereas the degradation of |FRAME:CPD-15680| is done by one single pathway (see |FRAME:PWY-7337|) the breakdown of its <i>trans</i>-isomer , i.e. |FRAME:CPD-15679| is realized via two metabolic routes |CITS:[15904873]|. The first part of the two pathways is catalyzed by the &beta;-oxidation enzymes POX1 |CITS: [2189786] [11431484]|, the multifunctional enzyme FOX2 |CITS:[1551874] [10497229] [16574148]| and the 3-keto-thiolase (POT1) |CITS:[7754706] [9402066] [7812714]| up to the formation of |FRAME:CPD-15661|. At this point the pathway splits up in two directions. The reductase-dependent pathway (see |FRAME:PWY-7338|) employs 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (SPS19) |CITS:[9268358] [1738316]| to direct further degradation. The other metabolic branch, i.e. the MFE-dependent pathway (this pathway) is characterized by the action of the multifunctional enzyme (MFE) trans-2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2/3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (FOX2) which is name-giving for a pathway that requires no participation of auxiliary enzymes.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>
/
/|FRAME:9-CIS11-TRANS-OCTADECADIENOATE 9-<i>cis</i>-11-<i>trans</i>-Octadecadienoate| and |FRAME:CPD-15704| belong to the compound family of positional and geometric isomers of |FRAME:LINOLEIC_ACID| (9-<i>cis</i>, 12-<i>cis</i>-octadecadienoate) known as conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs). The odd numbered conjugated |FRAME:9-CIS11-TRANS-OCTADECADIENOATE| (rumenic acid) and its even numbered conjugated isomer are found in dairy products and meat and arise through microbial conversion of |FRAME:LINOLEIC_ACID| in ruminant animals |CITS:[15522764]|. As component of human nutrition CLAs have been thoroughly researched and reported in animal studies to convey numerous beneficial properties. Amongst others CLAs have been associated with anticancer, anti-arteriosclerosis, immune strengthening and body fat reduction traits |CITS:[Banni98] [12055356]| but are also connected to studies with detrimental effects (reviewed in |CITS:[15522764]|).

/
/ 
/There are four potential pathways which can be considered in the degradation of |FRAME:CPD-15683|, one of them employing only &Delta;3-&Delta;2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (ECI1) whereas the other three depend at one point or another on the participation of &Delta;3,5,&Delta;2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase (DCI1). The isomerase-dependent pathway (this pathway) produces the intermediate |FRAME:CPD-15690| which is a unique marker for the pathway as it is not generated by &beta;-oxidation of endogenous yeast fatty acids. In addition the increase or decrease in the amount of this 12:1 monomer by analyzing the various mutants indicated what auxiliary enzymes are involved in the pathway and excluded the participation of &Delta;3,5,&Delta;2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase (DCI1) |CITS:[16040271]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME:NADH| and |FRAME:FADH2| are formed in the glycolytic and TCA cycles. Each of these energy-rich molecules has a pair of electrons with high transfer potential. The transfer of the electrons is performed by a series of four large electron carriers complexes also known as complex I-IV (electron transport chain or respiratory chain), present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of plants and mammals (see |FRAME: PWY-3781-1|). In general, the oxidation of |FRAME:NADH| and |FRAME:FADH2| results in an electron flow and causes protons to be pumped from the matrix side to the intermembrane space. As a result a proton-motive force (PMF) composed of a pH gradient and a membrane potential is generated. This PMF causes protons to flow back through the ATP-synthesizing complex of the energized mitochondrial membrane synthesizing |FRAME:ATP| in the process. |CITS: [DEY97]|.
/
/In contrast to the aerobic respiration of plants and animals <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> has no complex I and realizes the oxidation of |FRAME:NADH| and the resulting electron flow into the mitochiondrial electron chain via three NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases (NDI1, NDE1, NDE2) |CITS:[16706641] [11798023] [12961751]|. The internal NAD:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDI1) of the inner mitochondrial membrane facing the matrix side in concert with the two external NAD:ubiquinone oxidoreductases (NDE1, NDE2) |CITS:[9733747] [9696750] [10781551] [12032156]| of the inner mitochondrial membrane facing the intermembrane space is involved in the re-oxidation of cytosolic |FRAME:NADH|. From those three ubiquinone reductases the yeast NDI1 enzyme is the functional equivalent of complex I and represents the key entry point into the respiratory chain |CITS:[23086143] [1900238] [1735444] [3138118]|.
/
/The succinate dehydrogenase (SDH - complex II) is an enzyme that consists of 4 subunits which catalyze the sequential electron transport via the oxidation of |FRAME:SUC| to |FRAME:FUM| and reversible redox reactions coupled to a ubiquinone/ubiquinol pair into the transpiration chain. Two of the subunits (SDH1,SDH2) form a catalytic dimer containing the active site, bound FAD and three iron-sulfur clusters whereas the two other subunits (SDH3, SDH4) are integral membrane proteins which provide anchor and channel for complex II and constitute the ubiquinone reduction site |CITS:[13445213] [11803020]|. 
/
/Complex III of the respiratory chain, also referred to as cytochrome b-c1 complex, mediates the electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c.  The ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase of <i>Saccharomyces</i> consists of 13 subunits, 2 core and 5 lower molecular weight proteins and represents one of the so-called supercomplexes of the respiratory chain |CITS:[11798023] [22564912]|. The multi-subunit complex of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase couples the electron transfer to the translocation of protons across the membrane, hence, contributing substantially to the creation of the proton motive force which drives the |FRAME:ATP| formation of the oxidative phosphorylation |CITS:[18501197] [18038116]|. 
/
/Cytochrome c oxidase is on the receiving end of the electrons transferred from complex III. In <i>Saccharomyces</i> as in mammalian the cytochrome c oxidase is, under aerobic conditions, the terminal oxidase in the respiratory chain that catalyzes the transfer of the electrons to oxygen to form water. Again, the transfer of the electrons is connected to the transport of protons across the membrane adding to the PMF building up on the mitochondrial membrane |CITS:[21925484] [7851399]|.  Cytochrome c oxidase of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>  has been shown to be composed of 11 subunits forming a transmembrane multi-subunit enzyme that acts as a electron vehicle between complex III and complex IV |CITS:[2164355] [1665335]|. In yeast cytochrome c can also be reduced by the lactate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (CYB2) localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, however, possible functional implementations for a role in the respiratory chain remain to be determined |CITS:[6290489]|.

COMMENT - Chorismate, an intermediate in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids and the vitamins, p-aminobenzoate and p-hydroxybenzoate, is synthesized by the shikimate pathway. The shikimate pathway has been found to be common to all eukaryotes and prokaryotes studied thus far (as reported in |CITS:[1943992]|).
/
/In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the initial step is catalyzed by two deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase isoenzymes, one of which (|FRAME: YDR035W|) is feedback inhibited by phenylalanine, and the other (ARO4) by tyrosine |CITS:[1943992]|. Both DAHP isoenzymes are derepressed by amino acid starvation (general control of amino acid biosynthesis) |CITS:[2906401]|.
/
/The 5 subsequent reactions are catalyzed by a single pentafunctional enzyme, |FRAME: YDR127W| |CITS:[1943992][2825635]|. This enzyme is a mosaic of five monofunctional domains, each of which corresponding to one of five separate monofunctional |FRAME: TAX-562| enzymes |CITS:[1943992][2825635]|.
/
/The last step of chorismate biosynthesis, before the pathway branches to synthesize different terminal products, is catalyzed by |FRAME: YGL148W| |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.

COMMENT - The phosphorylated products of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns, PI), collectively referred to as phosphoinositides or phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PtdInsPs, PIPs), are membrane-bound lipids that function as structural components of membranes, as well as regulators of many cellular processes in eukaryotes, including vesicle-mediated membrane trafficking, cell wall integrity, and actin cytoskeleton organization (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]| and |CITS:[8599109]|). PtdInsPs are also precursors of the water-soluble inositol phosphates (IPs), an important class of intracellular signaling molecules (reviewed in |CITS:[16781889], [16429326], [17488633]|).
/
/The inositol ring of the membrane phospholipids and the water-soluble IPs are readily phosphorylated and dephosphorylated at a number of positions making them well suited as key regulators. PtdIns can be phosphorylated at one or a combination of positions (3', 4', or 5') on the inositol headgroup, generating a set of unique stereoisomers that have specific biological functions (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|). These stereoisomers have been shown to be restricted to certain membranes (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|). Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) is the major PtdInsP species of the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in the vesicular trafficking of secretory proteins from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns[4,5]P2) is the major species found at the plasma membrane and is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization, as well as cell wall integrity, and heat shock response pathways (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|). Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) is found predominantly at endosomal membranes and in multivesicular bodies (MVB), where it plays a role in endosomal and vacuolar membrane trafficking. Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns[3,5]P2) is found on vacuolar membranes where it plays an important role in the MVB sorting pathway (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|).
/
/Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the inositol headgroups of PtdInsPs at specific membrane locations signals the recruitment of certain proteins essential for vesicular transport (|CITS:[8599109]|, and reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|). PtdInsPs recruit proteins that contain PtdInsP-specific binding domains, such as the well-studied pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that recognizes the phosphorylation pattern of specific PtdInsP inositol headgroups (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|).
/
/A number of kinases and phosphatases are involved in the generation and interconversions of PtdInsPs, 
/the majority of which have been well conserved during evolution (reviewed in |CITS:[17382260]|). The 
/PtdInsP kinases, in contrast to the lipid phosphatases, have a higher degree of specificity. While each 
/kinase appears to phosphorylate only one substrate, many of the lipid phosphatases can dephosphorylate 
/a number of substrates.

COMMENT - Inositol phosphates (IPs) are an important class of signaling molecules that regulate cellular processes such as transcription, mRNA export, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, glucose-induced calcium signaling, telomere elongation, vacuolar biogenesis, the stress response, cell wall synthesis and phosphate homeostasis (reviewed in |CITS:[16781889]| and |CITS:[16429326]|).
/
/The water-soluble IPs are derived from the lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 
/(PIP2, PI(4,5)P2, PtdIns 4,5-P2). Plc1p hydrolyses PIP2 to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and
/ diacylglycerol, releasing IP3 from the membrane |CITS:[8395015]|.  IP3 is then sequentially
/ phosphorylated to inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP4) and inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5) by
/ the inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) Arg82p |CITS:[10720331][11311242][10683435]| and
/ reviewed in |CITS:[16781889]|. IP5 is further phosphorylated to inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6, phytate)
/ by Ipk1p or to the inositol pyrophosphate diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate (PP-IP4) by 
/Arg82p or Kcs1p |CITS:[10960485][10827188][11311242]| and reviewed in |CITS:[16781889]|. 
/The fully phosphorylated ring of IP6 is further phosphorylated to the inositol pyrophosphates 
/diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (PP-IP5, IP7) and bis-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate
/ (2[PP]-IP4, [PP]2-IP4, IP8) |CITS:[17412958][11956213][10574768]| reviewed in |CITS:[16781889]|
/ and |CITS:[16429326]|.  Two different forms of PP-IP5 have been identified, 5-PP-IP7 synthesized
/ by Kcs1p and 4- or 6-PP-IP7 synthesized by Vip1p (the exact phosphorylation position has yet to
/ be determined) |CITS:[17412958]|.  Kcs1p and Vip1p are believed to work in concert to form
/ [PP]2-IP4; the PP-IP5 product produced by one enzyme is converted to [PP]2-IP4 by the other
/ enzyme |CITS:[17412958]|. [PP]2-IP4 was shown to be dephosphorylated to PP-IP5 and PP-IP5
/ to IP6 by the phosphatase Ddp1p, but the particular isomer(s) are not yet known |CITS:[10419486]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The name trehalose was introduced in 1858 to describe a main constituent of shells that are secreted by various
/insects on tree leaves in the middle east.  These shells were often dried and used as a sweetening agents, and are
/believed to be related to the biblical Manna, the food supplied to the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness
/of Arabia.  One variety of these shells, produced by the beetles <i>Larinus maculatus</i> and <i>Larinus nidificans</i>
/was called "trehala manna", and the sugar extracted from it was named trehalique glucose, or trehalose
/|CITS: [12065209]|. 
/In fact, trehalose is a disaccharide that is ubiquitous in the biosphere. It consists of two subunits
/of glucose bound by an &alpha;:1-1 linkage (&alpha;-D-glucopyranosil &alpha;-D-glucopyranoside) and is thus
/nonreducing.  Trehalose has been isolated and characterized from many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, 
/including bacteria, yeast, plants, insects, and mammals |CITS: [11081789]| (and original references described therein). 
/
/In addition to being nonreducing, trehalose possesses several unique properties, including high hydrophilicity,
/chemical stability, nonhygroscopic glass formation, and no internal hydrogen bond formation. 
/The combination of these features explains the principal role of trehalose as a stress metabolite.
/
/In prokaryotic organisms, trehalose can be used as an external carbon source |CITS: [7651129]|, a compatible solute
/(in cyanobacteria and photosynthetic bacteria) |CITS: [8480996]|, a stress protector |CITS: [8391102]|, and a
/structural component (part of the cord factor in mycobacteria) |CITS: [8075141]|.
/In yeast and filamentous fungi, the main roles of trehalose are as a carbohydrate storage |CITS: [6325857]| and as
/a stress protector |CITS: [7887593]|.
/The enzymes for trehalose metabolism are present in higher animals, but their precise role is not well understood
/|CITS: [11081789]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/While |FRAME: CPD-12575| is the most common substrate for the biosynthesis of trehalose in yeast cells, it is not the sole donor.  An |FRAME: ADP-D-GLUCOSE|-dependent trehalose synthase has been identified in mutant strains of
/|FRAME: TAX-4932| lacking |FRAME: CPD-12575|-dependent trehalose synthase activity |CITS: [2532070]|. 
/
/Studies have shown that the two activities correspond to different proteins. While there are similarities between the two synthases (the apparent Km values for the respective nucleotide are similar, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> is required by both), they were clearly different in respect to activation by ATP Mg. Trehalose accumulation in these mutants was detected only in cells grown on weakly repressive carbon sources such as maltose and galactose or during the transition phase from fermentable to non-fermentable growth on glucose |CITS: [ 9133641]|.

COMMENT - In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, trehalose is a major reserve carbohydrate that has been shown to stabilize proteins during heat shock and to suppress the aggregation of denatured proteins |CITS:9660948|. Trehalose has also been shown to be important for surviving osmotic, ethanol, and oxidative stresses |CITS:11483159|.  Trehalose biosynthesis also influences glycolysis because trehalose-6-phosphate inhibits hexokinases, which restricts the influx of sugars into glycolysis during a switch to fermentative metabolism |CITS:8809751|. Trehalose biosynthesis is a two step process in which glucose 6-phosphate plus UDP-glucose is converted to alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS), and then alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate and water are converted to trehalose and phosphate by trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) |CITS:11152943|. In S. cerevisiae, both of these steps occur in a single alpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase complex which is composed of four protein subunits, Tps1p |CITS:1425702|, Tps2p |CITS:8444170|, Tsl1p |CITS:8404905|, and Tps3p |CITS:9837904|. Tps1p contains the TPS catalytic activity, Tps2p contains the TPP activity, and Tps3p and Tsl1p are regulatory proteins with partially overlapping functions |CITS:9837904|. Deletion of TPS1 results in loss of both TPS activity and trehalose biosynthesis while deletion of TPS2 results in loss of TPP activity. Deletion of either TSL1 or TPS3 result in mild effects, but deletion of both TSL1 and TSL3 results in significant reductions in TPS and TPP activities as well as reduced trehalose biosynthesis |CITS:9837904|.

COMMENT - Chorismate is an intermediate in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan and the vitamins, p-aminobenzoate and p-hydroxybenzoate |CITS:[Jones]|. The series of reactions to chorismate, called the shikimate pathway, are common for all of the aforementioned compounds, at which point the pathway branches |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|. One branch proceeds to tryptophan, one to phenylalanine and tyrosine, one to p-aminobenzoate, and one to p-hydroxybenzoate |CITS:[Jones][ 1943992]|.
/
/Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition, activation of enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The carbon flow through the pathways is regulated primarily at the initial step and the branching points by the terminal end-products.  The initial step of chorismate biosynthesis can be catalyzed by two isoenzymes, one of which (ARO3) is inhibited by phenylalanine, and the other (ARO4) by tyrosine |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The first step in the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine and activated by tryptophan |CITS:[1943992]|, and the first step in the tryptophan branch is feedback inhibited by tryptophan.  The transcriptional activator GCN4 regulates most of the genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes.

COMMENT - While Saccharomyces cerevisiae can use most amino acids as their sole nitrogen source, they can only use a few amino acids as a carbon source to support growth |CITS:[Large86][Cooper82]|.  This is in contrast to most eukaryotes and some fungi, which can metabolize amino acids completely, utilizing them as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen |CITS:[Stryer88][Large 86]|. S. cerevisiae degrade the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, iso-leucine, and valine) and the aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) via the Ehrlich pathway |CITS:[Sentheshanmuganathan60][10989420]|.  This pathway is comprised of the following steps:  1) deamination of the amino acid to the corresponding alpha-keto acid; 2) decarboxylation of the resulting alpha-keto acid to the respective aldehyde; and, 3) reduction of the aldehyde to form the corresponding long chain or complex alcohol, known as a fusel alcohol or fusel oil |CITS:[10989420][Large 86]|.  Fusel alcohols are important flavor and aroma compounds in yeast-fermented food products and beverages (as reported in |CITS:[9546164]|.
/
/Each of the three steps in branched-chain amino acid degradation can be catalyzed by more than one isozyme; which enzyme is used appears to depend on the amino acid, the carbon source and the stage of growth of the culture |CITS:[12499363]|. In leucine degradation, Thi3p is believed to be the major decarboxylase |CITS: [12499363]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME:THIAMINE Thiamine| (vitamin B1) is an essential  molecule that is required in all living organisms but is only produced in prokaryotes, yeasts and plants |CITS:[Rapala-Kozik11]|. The biosynthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| and its biological active derivate |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| is complex and can be achieved via different pathways in the various organisms (for instances see |FRAME:PWY-6894| |FRAME:PWY-6908| |FRAME:PWY-7356|) |CITS:[18161008] [22449018]||. Besides |FRAME:THIAMINE| and it's well characterized diphosphorylated derivative three more |FRAME:THIAMINE|phosphates have been shown to exist, i.e. |FRAME:THIAMINE-P|, |FRAME:CPD-611| and |FRAME:CPD0-1095| |CITS:[17334376] [19490098]|. 
/
/Although |FRAME:CPD-611| is found in most cells across all kingdoms its biosynthesis and biological role has only been partially elucidated and remains to be researched in more detail |CITS:[12943234]|. There is only insufficient knowledge about the biological role of |FRAME:CPD-611|. It appears that unlike |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|, |FRAME:CPD-611| does not act as an coenzyme but has been shown to be involved in the activation of anion channels and protein phosphorylation in vertebrates and acting as mediator (alarmone) in signaling pathways, e.g. under stress conditions like amino acid starvation in bacteria |CITS:[19490098] [14769791] [18215312] [8114078]|.
/
/|FRAME:CPD-611 Thiamine triphosphate| has also been found in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> |CITS:[13111284]| and its biosynthesis studied |CITS:[3034239]|. The corresponding enzyme, i.e. thiamine diphosphate kinase catalyzing the transfer of a phosphor from |FRAME:ATP| to |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| yielding |FRAME:CPD-611| and |FRAME:ADP| has been isolated and biochemically characterized in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> but its coding gene has not been identified yet. Although the oligomeric nature of the protein could be demonstrated the correct number and molecular weight of the subunits remains to be verified |CITS:[3034239]|. In contrast to the finding in yeast the bacterial biosynthetic route to |FRAME:CPD-611| originates from |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|  and |FRAME:Pi|, a reaction which appears to be fueled by the chemiosmotic force of the respiratory chain |CITS:[23323214]|. The reverse reaction from |FRAME:CPD-611| to |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|  catalyzed by a thiamine triphosphatase has been shown to exist in bacteria |CITS:[3026493] [3039089]| and vertebrates |CITS:[4335862]|  (reviewed in |CITS:[24021036]|) but reminds to be demonstrated in yeast.

COMMENT - In eukaryotes, N-linked (asparagine-linked) glycosylation is the most common form of protein modification of secretory and membrane proteins, and is involved in a variety of cellular processes, such as protein folding, sorting and stability (reviewed in |CITS: [15189166][8472892][3896128]|). 
/
/The initial steps of N-linked glycosylation, which are also known as the dolichol pathway of N-linked glycosylation, and lipid- and dolichol-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, involve the synthesis of a core oligosaccharide (glucosyl)<sub>3</sub>(mannosyl)<sub>9</sub>(N-acetylglucosamine)<sub>2</sub>, abbreviated, Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, on the lipid carrier, dolichol-pyrophosphate (Dol-PP) (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760][8472892][3896128]|).  The ordered assembly of the core oligosaccharide is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. The assembly starts on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-phosphate) is transferred from uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to dolichol-phosphate (Dol-P) followed by the addition of one N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and five mannose residues from UDP-GlcNAc and guanosine 5'-diphosphomannose (GDP-Man), respectively. The resulting lipid-linked precursor (Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-Dol) is translocated "flipped" into the lumen of the ER by a flippase, which which is endoded by <i>RFT1</i> in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.  Once in the lumen, the oligosaccharide is extended by four mannose and three glucose residues derived from dolichyl-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) and dolichyl-phosphate-glucose (Dol-P-Glc), respectively. The enzyme complex oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) transfers the preassembled oligosaccharide, Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, from the lipid carrier Dol-PP to selected asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides as the polypeptides pass into the lumen of the ER |CITS: [11580295]||CITS: [9405463]|.  
/
/Once attached to the protein, the N-linked oligosaccharide is further modified by a series of trimming and elongation reactions beginning in the ER and ending in the late Golgi compartment |CITS: [8054711]|. In the ER, the oligosaccharide is trimmed of its 3 glucose residues and a specific mannose residue to form Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>. The glucose residues are removed by glucosidases I and II, and in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> the mannose is removed by the alpha-1,2-mannosidase Mns1p, which is part of the editing mechanism that promotes the exit of correctly folded glycoproteins from the ER |CITS: [9732283]|.  Once the four monosaccharides are removed, the glycoproteins are transported from the ER to the Golgi, where the yeast and mammalian pathways diverge |CITS: [3304149]|.
/
/The lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthetic pathway is of particular interest in humans, because defects in the glycosyltransferases involved lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation |CITS: [11306275][17024709]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME:NAD| and its reduced and phosphorylated derivatives are essential metabolites in all organisms and are, except for protons, water and oxygen, integrated with more biochemical reactions than any other biochemical agent |CITS:[22404877]|. As major players involved in energy metabolism, electron transfer and indispensable metabolic cycles the various |FRAME:NAD| species have attracted much attention and generated significant research efforts in elucidating their specific roles in relevant catalyses. In addition, there is growing evidence that |FRAME:NAD| species also operate in signaling pathways |CITS:[19211509] [21349851]|.   
/
/In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> the interconvertibility of the various |FRAME:NAD| species is of utmost importance for maintaining the redox balance of the cells which, in turn determines growth efficiency and metabolite excretion |CITS:[1900238]|. The various pyridine nucleotides, in particular |FRAME:NADH| cannot permeate the inner membrane of mitochondrion. For that reason direct transversal exchanges of |FRAME:NAD| and reduced and/or phosphorylated derivatives from the cytosol to the mitochondria and vice versa are not possible. Moreover, yeast does not possess transhydrogenases, hence cannot directly convert |FRAME:NAD| and |FRAME:NADPH| into |FRAME:NADP| and |FRAME:NADH| |CITS:[3789705]|. Consequently, to ensure the availability of the required |FRAME:NAD| metabolites in each organelle, yeast has developed independent sets of interconversion reactions that provide the supply of all |FRAME:NAD| types through various enzymatic reactions.
/
/In the cytoplasm two NAD kinases have been characterized that can phosphorylate |FRAME:NAD|. The main cytosolic NAD kinase is encoded by UTR1 |CITS:[16760478] [11425472]|. A second, less important NAD kinase for phosphorylation of |FRAME:NAD|, i.e. YEF1 has also been described and shown to compensate for the loss of UTR1 |CITS:[15978040]|. The deletion of both the mitochondrial POS5 (see |FRAME: PWY-7269-YEAST|) and cytosolic UTR1 is lethal in yeast and YEF1 can only compensate when POS5 still operates. These findings support the notion that the main NADH kinases of yeast, i.e. POS5 and UTR1 can partially compensate for the loss of one's respective activity |CITS:[16760478]|. Both UTR1 and YEF1 have been shown to exhibit NADH kinase activity as well providing the cytosolic set of enzymes with the catalytic ability to phosphorylate |FRAME:NADH| |CITS:[15978040] [16760478]|. 
/
/Various enzymatic reactions have been shown to account for the provision of the cytosol with |FRAME:NADPH| required for biosynthetic pathways and anti-oxidant functions. The cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase encoded by ALD6 |CITS:[9392076] [9473035]|  and the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (ZWF1) catalyzing the first step in the |FRAME:PENTOSE-P-PWY| to convert |FRAME:GLC-6-P| to |FRAME:D-6-P-GLUCONO-DELTA-LACTONE| |CITS:[2269430] [12584194] [11557322]| are considered as the main suppliers of |FRAME:NADPH|. A third enzyme producing |FRAME:NADPH| in the cytoplasm is the cytosolic NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDP2) |CITS:[8068643] [15574419]|. It has been demonstrated that ZWF1 has overlapping functions with the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDP2) and the acetaldehyde oxidoreductase (ALD6) indicating the compensation for the deficiency of |FRAME:NADPH| should one of the involved reactions fail to operate |CITS:[16179340]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME:NAD| and its reduced and phosphorylated derivatives are essential metabolites in all organisms and are, except for protons, water and oxygen, integrated with more biochemical reactions than any other biochemical agent |CITS:[22404877]|. As major players involved in energy metabolism, electron transfer and indispensable metabolic cycles the various |FRAME:NAD| species have attracted much attention and generated significant research efforts in elucidating their specific roles in relevant catalyses. In addition, there is growing evidence that |FRAME:NAD| species also operate in signaling pathways |CITS:[19211509] [21349851]|.   
/
/In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> the interconvertibility of the various |FRAME:NAD| species is of utmost importance for maintaining the redox balance of the cells which, in turn determines growth efficiency and metabolite excretion |CITS:[1900238]|.  For example, Baker's yeast requires |FRAME:NADPH| in the mitochondria for protection against oxidative stress and the operation of several biosynthetic pathways |CITS:[12727869]|. The various pyridine nucleotides, in particular |FRAME:NADH| cannot permeate the inner membrane of mitochondrion. For that reason direct transversal exchanges of |FRAME:NAD| and reduced and/or phosphorylated derivatives from the cytosol to the mitochondria and vice versa are not possible. Moreover, yeast does not possess transhydrogenases, hence cannot directly convert |FRAME:NAD| and |FRAME:NADPH| into |FRAME:NADP| and |FRAME:NADH| |CITS:[3789705]|. Consequently, to ensure the availability of the required |FRAME:NAD| metabolites in each organelle, yeast has developed independent sets of interconversion reactions that provide the supply of all |FRAME:NAD| types through various enzymatic reactions.
/
/In the mitochondria of <i>Saccharomyces</i> two main sources for the generation of |FRAME:NADPH| have been proposed. The NADH kinase encoded by the POS5 gene is considered to be the main provider of |FRAME:NADPH| in the mitochondrion by phosphorylation of |FRAME:NADH|. However, since POS5 also works as NAD kinase |CITS:[12727869] [12912900]| this reaction followed by the dehydrogenase reaction of |FRAME:MONOMER-13666|/|FRAME:MONOMER-13665| |CITS:[9675847] [9059631]| is the other source for the synthesis of |FRAME:NADPH| in <i>Saccharomyces</i> mitochondria |CITS: [19158096]|. The deletion of both the mitochondrial POS5 and cytosolic UTR1 (see |FRAME:PWY-7268|) is lethal in yeast but the loss of one of the main NADH kinases can be partially compensated |CITS:[16760478]|. The oxidation of cytosolic |FRAME:NADH| via the mitochondrial respiration chain is catalyzed by three NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases, one internal, i.e. NDI1 |CITS:[23086143] [1900238] [1735444] [3138118]| and two external, i.e. NDE1/NDE2 |CITS:[9733747] [9696750] [10781551] [12032156]|. The malate-aspartate shuttle in coordination with the 2 external NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases is also considered to contribute to the reoxidation of cytosolic |FRAME:NADH| |CITS:[9696750]|.

COMMENT - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential cofactor for cellular redox reactions and energy 
/metabolism.  NAD also has been shown to be an important substrate in a variety of biological processes, 
/including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, calcium-dependent signaling pathways, 
/calorie-restriction-mediated life-span extension and age-associated diseases 
/|CITS: [12736687],[12648681]|. NAD appears to affect these processes by regulating the Sir2p family of 
/NAD-dependent deacetylases (Sirtuins) |CITS: [12648681]|. 
/
/There are a number of pathways for NAD biosynthesis.  In yeast and most other organisms, the two major 
/pathways are de novo synthesis of NAD (the de novo pathway) and regeneration of NAD from its 
/nicotinamide degradation products (the NAD salvage pathway) |CITS: [12972620], [12648681]|. NAD is 
/synthesized de novo from tryptophan via kynurenine |CITS: [12972620]|. In this pathway tryptophan is 
/converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) in 6 enzymatic steps (catalyzed by Bna1-2p, and 
/Bna4-7p) and one non-enzymatic step |CITS: [12972620]|. At NAMN the de novo pathway converges with 
/the NAD salvage pathway and the last two steps to NAD are shared |CITS: [12972620], [12648681]|. In 
/the yeast NAD salvage pathway, the vitamin precursors nicotinamide and nicotinic acid are converted to 
/NAMN, the point of convergence with the de novo pathway |CITS: [12648681]|.  The steps from nicotinic 
/acid to NAD were elucidated by Preiss and Handler and are sometimes referred to as the Preiss-Handler 
/pathway |CITS: [13416279], [13563526]|. Yeast can also import extracellular nicotinic acid into the cell by 
/the permease Tna1p and then convert it into NAD via the Preiss-Handler pathway |CITS: [12648681]|.
/
/There are four additional pathways for synthesizing NAD in yeast: two salvage pathways from the vitamin 
/precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) and two salvage pathways from nicotinic acid riboside (NaR) 
/|CITS: [15137942], [17482543], [17914902]|. Three of these salvage pathways converge first with the NAD 
/salvage pathway and then with the de novo pathway, while the fourth, the NR salvage pathway I, is 
/independent of both of these pathways. In the NR salvage pathway I, NR is phosphorylated to 
/nicotinamide mononucleotide by the kinase Nrk1p, and then adenylated to NAD by Nma1p or Nma2p 
/|CITS: [15137942]|. Bacteria such as Haemophilus influenza that lack the enzymes of the de novo and 
/Preiss-Handler pathway can synthesize NAD from NR and nicotinamide mononucleotide as well 
/|CITS: [15137942]|. Humans also appear to have this NR salvage pathway |CITS: [15137942]|. Yeast have 
/a second NR salvage pathway (NR salvage pathway II) that is independent of Nrk1p; in NR salvage 
/pathway II NR is split into a ribosyl product and nicotinamide, which is subsequently converted to NAD 
/via enzymes of the NAD salvage pathway and de novo pathway |CITS: [17482543]|. The initial steps in 
/the two NaR salvage pathways are similar to those of the NR salvage pathways and are catalyzed by the 
/same enzymes; Nrk1p catalyzes the first step in the NR and NaR salvage pathways I and Urh1p and 
/Pnp1p catalyze the first steps of the NR and NaR salvage pathways II |CITS: [17914902]|.

COMMENT - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential cofactor for cellular redox reactions and energy 
/metabolism.  NAD also has been shown to be an important substrate in a variety of biological processes, 
/including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, calcium-dependent signaling pathways, 
/calorie-restriction-mediated life-span extension and age-associated diseases 
/|CITS: [12736687],[12648681]|. NAD appears to affect these processes by regulating the Sir2p family of 
/NAD-dependent deacetylases (Sirtuins) |CITS: [12648681]|. 
/
/There are a number of pathways for NAD biosynthesis.  In yeast and most other organisms, the two major 
/pathways are de novo synthesis of NAD (the de novo pathway) and regeneration of NAD from its 
/nicotinamide degradation products (the NAD salvage pathway) |CITS: [12972620], [12648681]|. NAD is 
/synthesized de novo from tryptophan via kynurenine |CITS: [12972620]|. In this pathway tryptophan is 
/converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) in 6 enzymatic steps (catalyzed by Bna1-2p, and 
/Bna4-7p) and one non-enzymatic step |CITS: [12972620]|. At NAMN the de novo pathway converges with 
/the NAD salvage pathway and the last two steps to NAD are shared |CITS: [12972620], [12648681]|. In 
/the yeast NAD salvage pathway, the vitamin precursors nicotinamide and nicotinic acid are converted to 
/NAMN, the point of convergence with the de novo pathway |CITS: [12648681]|.  The steps from nicotinic 
/acid to NAD were elucidated by Preiss and Handler and are sometimes referred to as the Preiss-Handler 
/pathway |CITS: [13416279], [13563526]|. Yeast can also import extracellular nicotinic acid into the cell by 
/the permease Tna1p and then convert it into NAD via the Preiss-Handler pathway |CITS: [12648681]|.
/
/There are four additional pathways for synthesizing NAD in yeast: two salvage pathways from the vitamin 
/precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) and two salvage pathways from nicotinic acid riboside (NaR) 
/|CITS: [15137942], [17482543], [17914902]|. Three of these salvage pathways converge first with the NAD 
/salvage pathway and then with the de novo pathway, while the fourth, the NR salvage pathway I, is 
/independent of both of these pathways. In the NR salvage pathway I, NR is phosphorylated to 
/nicotinamide mononucleotide by the kinase Nrk1p, and then adenylated to NAD by Nma1p or Nma2p 
/|CITS: [15137942]|. Bacteria such as Haemophilus influenza that lack the enzymes of the de novo and 
/Preiss-Handler pathway can synthesize NAD from NR and nicotinamide mononucleotide as well 
/|CITS: [15137942]|. Humans also appear to have this NR salvage pathway |CITS: [15137942]|. Yeast have 
/a second NR salvage pathway (NR salvage pathway II) that is independent of Nrk1p; in NR salvage 
/pathway II NR is split into a ribosyl product and nicotinamide, which is subsequently converted to NAD 
/via enzymes of the NAD salvage pathway and de novo pathway |CITS: [17482543]|. The initial steps in 
/the two NaR salvage pathways are similar to those of the NR salvage pathways and are catalyzed by the 
/same enzymes; Nrk1p catalyzes the first step in the NR and NaR salvage pathways I and Urh1p and 
/Pnp1p catalyze the first steps of the NR and NaR salvage pathways II |CITS: [17914902]|.

COMMON-NAME - oleate biosynthesis
CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3766515103:caspi
COMMENT - Unsaturated fatty acids are essential for all eukaryotes; they are key components of cellular membranes and are used for energy storage.  While most eukaryotes can synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can only form monounsaturated fatty acids, primarily |FRAME: CPD-9245| (16:l) and |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| (18:1) (|FRAME: PWY3O-1801| and |FRAME:PWY-5996|). 
/
/The monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleate (16:l) and oleate (18:1) are formed by the introduction of a single carbon - carbon double bond into the saturated fatty acyl-CoA, palmitoyl and stearoyl-CoA, respectively. OLE1 encodes the sole S. cerevisiae delta-9 fatty acid desaturase, an ER membrane-bound protein that is required for the production of monounsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [1978720]|. Ole1p catalyzes the formation of a double bond between carbons 9 and 10 (denoted by delta-9) in the cis configuration.  Other fungi and eukaryotes have additional fatty acid desaturases that can produce double bonds in the delta12 and delta15 position.  
/
/The Ole1p sequence is similar to homologs in rat and human (SCD1) over the majority of the protein, including a cluster of histidine residues that coordinate the binding of a diiron-oxo prosthetic group within the catalytic site (reviewed in |CITS: [16920014]|). The rat and yeast proteins are similar enough that exogenously expressed rat protein can rescue an ole1 null mutant |CITS: [1978720]|. However, Ole1p has an additional C-terminal, 113 amino acid extension (relative to the rat protein), which encodes a cytochrome b5-like domain not found in mammalian desaturases. In animal cells, cytochrome b5 is thought to be the electron donor for fatty acid desaturation. In contrast, the yeast cytochrome b5 (Cyb5) is dispensable for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids because Ole1p contains inherent electron donor activity. The rat protein is unable to rescue an ole1 cyb5 double mutant |CITS:[8530368]|.
/
/OLE1 is highly regulated at the levels of both transcription and mRNA stability (reviewed in |CITS: [16920014 ]| and |CITS: [17087771]|). OLE1 transcription is decreased in response to high fatty acid levels |CITS: [2687232][1556107]| and increased in response to low oxygen |CITS: [10318903]| and low temperature |CITS: [11855848]|. Much of the transcriptional regulation is mediated by two homologous ER membrane-bound transcription factors, Spt23p and Mga2p. In response to stimuli, both Spt23p and Mga2p are activated by ubiquitin-dependent processing into their soluble forms, and then targeted to the nucleus |CITS: [9927444][11007476] [11557770]|. Independent of the transcriptional regulation, OLE1 mRNA is also stabilized under fatty acid free conditions and destabilized when fatty acids are added to the growth medium |CITS: [8824209]|. Mga2p, but not Spt23p, contributes to the regulation of OLE1 mRNA stability |CITS: [15220333]|.

COMMENT - The polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, and |FRAME:SPERMINE|) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in any biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes |CITS: [3157043][4873311][1409623][2185470]|. While it is clear that polyamines are essential for normal cell growth, we still do not fully understand their specific molecular functions <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[3157043]|. |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| are found in all life forms, and |FRAME:SPERMINE| is found mostly in eukaryotes.
/
/|FRAME:PUTRESCINE Putrescine| can be formed either directly from |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (see |FRAME:PWY-46|) or indirectly from |FRAME:ARG| by arginine decarboxylase (ADC) (see |FRAME:PWY-40| and |FRAME:PWY-43|). While the ODC pathway was considered the only mammalian pathway for polyamine biosynthesis, recently the presence of the ADC pathway in mammals has been demonstrated |CITS:[11804860] [14738999]|.  In higher plants the presence of both pathways has been known for some time |CITS: [11537482]|. In bacteria, both pathways are common, and are often found side by side in the same organism |CITS:[3157043]|.  In the hyperthermophilic archaeon |FRAME: TAX-69014| both this pathway and pathway |FRAME:PWY-6834| may lead to the synthesis of longer chain polyamines, with the latter pathway being the main route |CITS: [20675472]|.
/
/In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> the pathway is realized via the ODC pathway. |FRAME:SPERMIDINE Spermidine| is formed by |FRAME:YPR069C-MONOMER| which has been characterized through the complementation of a mutant strain (&Delta;spe3). It has been demonstrated that |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| was absolutely necessary for such mutants to restore wild-type growth and sporulation |CITS:[9073064]|. The null mutant &Delta;spe3 accumulates |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| which is an activator of |FRAME:CPLX3O-10520| providing the propylamine moiety necessary to form |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| |CITS:[11526206]|. The formed other product of the reaction |FRAME:S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINAMINE| is not only a strong competitive inhibitor for the |FRAME:CPLX3O-10520| but is poisonous for yeast when accumulating in &Delta;spe3 mutants |CITS:[9073064]|.
/
/|FRAME:SPERMIDINE Spermidine| is formed by the addition of a propylamine moiety to |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, catalyzed by an aminopropyltransferase termed |FRAME: CPLX-6907|. The source of the propylamine group is decarboxylated |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (|FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINAMINE|) which is produced by the action of the pyruvoyl-containing enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-6906|. The other product of the aminopropyltransferase reaction is |FRAME:5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA), which is recycled back to |FRAME: MET|.

COMMON-NAME - biotin biosynthesis from 8-amino-7-oxononanoate I
CITATIONS - 10333520:EV-EXP-IDA:3570718377:caspi
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: BIOTIN "Biotin"| is a water soluble, heterocyclic cofactor for a small number of enzymes that facilitate the transfer of CO<sub>2</sub> during carboxylation, decarboxylation, and transcarboxylation reactions involved in fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism |CITS: [SHELLHAMMER90][11706201][15012185]|. 
/The biotin-requiring enzymes identified so far (including |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|,
/|FRAME: CPLX66-17|, |FRAME: CPLX-5203|, and |FRAME: CPLX-6001|) play essential roles in cell metabolism
/|CITS: [8676868]|. 
/Biotin may also have functions in metabolism other than its mere catalytic role as an enzyme cofactor. It has been
/shown that biotin also carries out non-catalytic functions in the expression of methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase
/in <i>Arabidopsis</i> biotin-auxotroph mutants, by modulating and regulating gene expression |CITS: [12644697]|. 
/
/Biotin biosynthesis is found in plants, bacteria, and certain fungi. Although animals and most fungi cannot synthesize their own biotin, a daily intake is required for normal growth and development |CITS: [11322938]|. 
/The biotin biosynthetic pathway has been explored in detail in bacteria. Sequencing analysis and some experimental evidence suggests that the steps in bacterial biotin synthesis are conserved in plants |CITS: [11322938]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: TAX-4932| is not able to synthesize biotin <i>de novo</i> from basic precursors. However, it has the ability to synthesize biotin from |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE|, which it can import from the environmet by the transporter encoded by the |FRAME: G3O-33362| gene |CITS: [10333520]|.
/
/The first step in this part of the pathway involves the unusual use of the common methyl-group donor |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as an amino-group donor, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: YNR058W|-encoded |FRAME: YNR058W-MONOMER|. This product of this reaction, |FRAME: DIAMINONONANOATE|, is the target of a unique carboxylase, the |FRAME: YNR057C|-encoded |FRAME: YNR057C-MONOMER|. This enzye catalyzes the first ring closure by a carboxylation reaction that does not require biotin as a prosthetic group, forming |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN| |CITS: [4921568]|.
/
/The ultimate step in the pathway is catalyzed by |FRAME: YGR286C-MONOMER|, encoded by |FRAME: YGR286C|.
/This enzyme inserts a sulfur atom between C6 and C9 of dethiobiotin in a |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|-dependent reaction. It has not been possible to reconstitute a catalytic reaction of this enzyme <i>in vitro</i>, and there is some uncertainty regarding the reaction mechanism, cofactor requirements, and the source of the sulfur atom |CITS: [15850974]|. However, recent experiments have suggested that a |FRAME: CPD-6| of the enzyme is the source of the sulfur atom.  Consistent with its proposed role as the sulfur donor, degradation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster |CITS: [14967042]| as well as exchange of sulfur atoms between the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters |CITS: [16533066]| is observed during turnover of the enzyme.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Fatty acids are key building blocks for the phospholipid components of cell membranes and are determinants of intracellular communication, in the form of lipid second messengers |CITS: [11094259]|, and fatty acyl moieties of proteins that modify their location and function |CITS: [10446384]|.
/
/There are two basic types of fatty acid (FAS) biosynthesis mechanisms, named type I and type II. The type I system is found in animals and lower eukaryotes. The mammalian system consists of a single gene product that contains all of the reaction centers required to produce a fatty acid (see |FRAME: CPLX-7628| from |FRAME: TAX-9606|), while the system of lower eukaryotes (such as yeast) consists of two multifunctional proteins, &alpha; and &beta;, arranged in an &alpha;<sub>6</sub>&beta;<sub>6</sub> complex (see |FRAME: CPLX-7627| from |FRAME: TAX-4932|).
/
/Type II systems are found in bacteria, plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the |FRAME: TAX-5794| phylum |CITS: [17112527]| and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|. The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as thioesters of |FRAME: ACP|.
/
/A major difference between the two pathways is that the type I systems accept |FRAME:MALONYL-COA| as the source of two-carbon units, while the type II systems accept |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP|. Pathways catalyzed by type II systems are described by |FRAME: PWY-5971|, |FRAME: PWY66-430|, and |FRAME: PWY-7388|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Fatty acid synthases from lower eukaryotes consist of two multifunctional proteins, &alpha; and &beta;, arranged in an &alpha;<sub>6</sub>&beta;<sub>6</sub> complex. Five of the seven enzymatic activities reside in the &beta; subunit, while the remaining two activities and the acyl-carrier protein domain are in the &alpha; subunit |CITS: [365179][1100391][10785388][3528750][374077]|.
/
/The process is initiated by the sequential transfer of a primer substrate, usually an acetyl moiety, from CoA thioester form, first to the nucleophilic serine residue of the acyltransferase domain, then to the phosphopantetheine thiol of the acyl-carrier protein (ACP) domain, and finally to the active site cysteine residue of the &beta;-ketoacyl synthase domain (see |FRAME: PWY-5966-1|). 
/
/In the next step the chain extender substrate, a malonyl moiety, is transferred from its CoA thioester form via the nucleophilic serine residue of the acyltransferase domain to the phosphopantetheine thiol. Formation of a new C-C bond, by condensation of the acetyl and malonyl moieties, is coupled with an energetically favorable decarboxylation. The 3-oxoacyl condensation product is then reduced to a saturated acyl moiety through the sequential action of a 3-oxoacyl reductase, (3<i>R</i>)-3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase, and enoyl reductase, and the newly formed saturated acyl moiety is translocated back to the active site cysteine residue, in a reaction catalyzed by the &beta;-ketoacyl synthase domain.
/
/The phosphopantetheine thiol of the ACP domain is then reloaded with a new malonyl moiety, and another round takes place. After completion of seven cycles of chain extension, when the acyl group has reached 16 carbon atoms, the saturated acyl moiety is released from the phosphopantetheine thiol through the action of the chain-terminating thioesterase domain. Although small amounts of |FRAME: STEARIC_ACID| are sometimes formed through the actions of FAS, the process generally stops at 16 carbons and |FRAME: PALMITATE| is released from the ACP moiety |CITS: [16477801]|.
/
/The sum of reactions catalyzed by the yeast enzyme is described by EC reaction 2.3.1.86:
/
/|FRAME: FATTY-ACYL-COA-SYNTHASE-RXN|
/
/|FRAME: PALMITATE Palmitate| is one of the most common saturated fatty acids found in animals and plants. It was discovered by Edmond Fremy in 1840 in saponified palm oil, of which it is a major component, hence its name.
/
/FASs are regulated at the transcriptional and translational level as well as posttranslationally. In yeast, FAS is a housekeeping enzyme that is expressed constitutively at a low level, but its expression is also activated by the general yeast transcription factors Rap1, Abf1 and Reb1 |CITS: [7925441]| and theinositol/choline-responsive transcription factor heterodimer, Ino2p-Ino4p |CITS: [1461729][7862526]|. The coordinate expression of the two subunits also appears to be regulated by Fas1p controlling the expression of FAS2 |CITS: [11713312]|. The FAS subunits are further regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess subunits. While the intact FAS multimeric complex (alpha6beta6 ) is stable, its individual subunits are rapidly degraded |CITS: [1735446][8262967]|.

COMMENT - Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is the active form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> and is a cofactor in many reactions
/ of amino acid metabolism. Pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxamine (PM), pyridoxal (PL), 
/pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) are all forms of
/ vitamin B<sub>6</sub> that can be converted to PLP via the PLP salvage pathway. 
/Most unicellular organisms and plants can synthesize PLP, whereas mammals cannot and require vitamin B<sub>6</sub> in their diet.  Thus far, three PLP biosynthetic pathways have been characterized: the de novo PLP biosynthesis pathway as characterized in <I>Escherichia coli</I> |CITS: [12686115]|, the de novo PLP biosynthesis pathway as being studied in fungi |CITS: [15483325],[14764090]|, and the PLP salvage pathway |CITS: [15483325], [17696614],[8764513],[9537380]|. <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> synthesize PLP via the fungal type de novo PLP synthesis pathway and the PLP salvage pathway |CITS: [7896706], [17696614], [15483325], [14764090]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE "Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate"| (PLP, vitamin B6) is an essential cofactor in all living systems |CITS: [7748903]|. It plays an important role in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and has also been implicated in singlet oxygen resistance |CITS: [11701851]|. 
/
/Some anaerobic bacteria, such as E. coli, synthsize |FRAME: PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| from |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P| and |FRAME: DEOXYXYLULOSE-5P| in a multistep pathway, as described in |FRAME: PYRIDOXSYN-PWY|. However, most bacteria, as well as archaebacteria, fungi, and plants synthesize PLP in a single complex reaction, as described in here. 
/
/The reaction is catalyzed by the |FRAME: CPLX-8031|, a dimeric complex that includes two different subunits |CITS: [16030023]|. The |FRAME: MONOMER-15503 "glutamine hydrolase"| subunit (encoded by |FRAME: G-11883|) catalyzes the hydrolysis of |FRAME: GLN|, producing |FRAME: GLT| and |FRAME: AMMONIA| |CITS: [14585832]|. The ammonia is not released from the enzyme - instead, it is channeled to the active site of the |FRAME: MONOMER-15502 "synthase subunit"| (|FRAME: G-11882|) by a 100&Aring; tunnel.
/
/The synthase subunit (Pdx1, |FRAME: G-11882|) condenses the ammonium with |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P| and |FRAME: GAP| in a complex series of reactions and produces |FRAME: PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| |CITS: [18271580]|.
/
/The purified proteins have been used <i>in vitro</i> in a reconstituted system |CITS: [15771487]|, and a detailed model for the enzyme's mechanism has been suggested |CITS: [17189272][18271580][18260082][18516049]|.

/The formation of |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> also happens independent of |FRAME:DEOXYXYLULOSE-5P| (DXP). The |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| synthase complex consists of two subunits, i.e. |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| synthase encoded by SNZ1 catalyzing the final formation of |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| and a glutaminase encoded by SNO1 providing the |FRAME:AMMONIA| which is the source for the ring nitrogen. It has been demonstrated that the |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| synthase not only catalyzes the final formation of |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| but also carries out the isomerization of |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| to |FRAME:GAP| and |FRAME:RIBOSE-5P| to |FRAME:RIBULOSE-5P|, the latter being the preferred substrates for the |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| synthase. The enzyme has been crystallized and characterized with regard to structure and reaction sequence |CITS:[19523954] [20919991]|. The gene encoding the glutaminase, i.e. SNO1 has been demonstrated to only exhibit glutaminase activity when expressed in complex with SNZ1 |CITS:[14764090]|. From the 3 members in both the SNZ and SNO gene families only the pair SNZ1/SNO1 have been shown to be co-regulated and involved in vitamin B6 (|FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE|) formation |CITS:[12271461] [12649274] [9791124]|.

COMMENT - Unsaturated fatty acids are essential for all eukaryotes; they are key components of cellular membranes and are used for energy storage.  While most eukaryotes can synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can only form monounsaturated fatty acids, primarily |FRAME: CPD-9245| (16:l) and |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| (18:1) (|FRAME: PWY3O-1801| and |FRAME: PWY-5996|).
/
/The monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleate (16:l) and oleate (18:1) are formed by the introduction of a single carboUnsaturated fatty acids are essential for all eukaryotes; they are key components of cellular membranes and are used for energy storage.  While most eukaryotes can synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can only form monounsaturated fatty acids, primarily palmitoleate (16:l) and oleate (18:1). n - carbon double bond into the saturated fatty acyl-CoA, palmitoyl and stearoyl-CoA, respectively. OLE1 encodes the sole S. cerevisiae delta-9 fatty acid desaturase, an ER membrane-bound protein that is required for the production of monounsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [1978720]|. Ole1p catalyzes the formation of a double bond between carbons 9 and 10 (denoted by delta-9) in the cis configuration.  Other fungi and eukaryotes have additional fatty acid desaturases that can produce double bonds in the delta12 and delta15 position.  
/
/The Ole1p sequence is similar to homologs in rat and human (SCD1) over the majority of the protein, including a cluster of histidine residues that coordinate the binding of a diiron-oxo prosthetic group within the catalytic site (reviewed in |CITS: [16920014]|). The rat and yeast proteins are similar enough that exogenously expressed rat protein can rescue an ole1 null mutant |CITS: [1978720]|. However, Ole1p has an additional C-terminal, 113 amino acid extension (relative to the rat protein), which encodes a cytochrome b5-like domain not found in mammalian desaturases. In animal cells, cytochrome b5 is thought to be the electron donor for fatty acid desaturation. In contrast, the yeast cytochrome b5 (Cyb5) is dispensable for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids because Ole1p contains inherent electron donor activity. The rat protein is unable to rescue an ole1 cyb5 double mutant |CITS:[8530368]|.
/
/OLE1 is highly regulated at the levels of both transcription and mRNA stability (reviewed in |CITS: [16920014 ]| and |CITS: [17087771]|). OLE1 transcription is decreased in response to high fatty acid levels |CITS: [2687232][1556107]| and increased in response to low oxygen |CITS: [10318903]| and low temperature |CITS: [11855848]|. Much of the transcriptional regulation is mediated by two homologous ER membrane-bound transcription factors, Spt23p and Mga2p. In response to stimuli, both Spt23p and Mga2p are activated by ubiquitin-dependent processing into their soluble forms, and then targeted to the nucleus |CITS: [9927444][11007476] [11557770]|. Independent of the transcriptional regulation, OLE1 mRNA is also stabilized under fatty acid free conditions and destabilized when fatty acids are added to the growth medium |CITS: [8824209]|. Mga2p, but not Spt23p, contributes to the regulation of OLE1 mRNA stability |CITS: [15220333]|.

COMMENT - Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan proceeds via a common pathway to chorismate, at which point the pathway branches.  One branch proceeds to tryptophan and the other to phenylalanine and tyrosine |CITS:[Jones]|.
/
/Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition, activation of enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The carbon flow through the pathways are regulated primarily at the initial step and the branching points by the terminal end-products.  The initial step of chorismate biosynthesis can be catalyzed by either isoenzyme Aro3p or Aro4p; Aro3p is inhibited by phenylalanine, and Aro4p by tyrosine |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The first step in the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine and activated by tryptophan |CITS:[1943992]|, and the first step in the tryptophan branch is feedback inhibited by tryptophan.  Most of the genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes are regulated by the transcriptional activator GCN4.

COMMENT - The homeostasis of glycerophospholipids constitutes an indispensable element for buildup, maintenance and component dynamics of cell membranes in all organisms. The many different phospholipid molecular species found in yeast basically vary in their composition of fatty acids esterified to the sn-1 and sn-2 position of a phosphorylated |FRAME:GLYCEROL| and a head group which can either be a |FRAME:CHOLINE|, |FRAME:ETHANOL-AMINE|, |FRAME:SER|, |FRAME:MYO-INOSITOL| or the one phospholipid without a head group, i.e. phosphatidate (for example |FRAME:CPD-8291|) |CITS:[14321173] [22345606]|. After the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of phospholipids in the Kennedy pathway (see |FRAME:TRIGLSYN-PWY|, |FRAME:PWY3O-450|) glycerophospholipids can be degraded (see |FRAME:LIPAS-PWY|) and remodeled (this pathway; see also |FRAME:PWY-7416| and |FRAME:PWY-7417|). The latter has been proposed by William E.M. Lands |CITS:[14413818]| who describes in the eponymous 'Lands cycle' a de-acylation-re-acylation process of phospholipids typically characterized by saturated acyl chains at the sn-1 and unsaturated acyl chains at the sn-2 position |CITS:[7871882]|.
/
/This remodeling process starts with the de-acylation at the sn-2 position of phospholipids catalyzed by phospholipases (e.g. phospholipase A2) generating the corresponding lyso-phospholipids. The resulting lyso-phospholipids represent the substrates for acyl-CoA dependent lyso-phospholipid acyltransferases or phospholipid transacylases which can re-acylate the sn-2 position. Generally, the Lands cycle constitutes an exchange of fatty acids at the sn-2 position which is an substantial factor in the maintenance of the homeostasis of phospholipids |CITS:[17010666]|. This de- and re-acylation process translates into many physiological functions, for example increasing membrane fluidity through a higher percentage of unsaturated acyl chains, re-esterification of exogenous lyso-phospholipids |CITS:[17726007]|, buffering excess toxic fatty acids |CITS:[22090344] [19608739]| and maintenance of the intrinsic membrane curvature necessary to preserve membrane integrity |CITS:[16339082] [31173]|.
/
/In the phosphatidylethanolamine remodeling pathway the de-acylation of |FRAME:CPD-8355| is catalyzed by the phospholipase A2 activity of the triacylglycerol lipase TGL4p |CITS:[16135509] [16267052] [20332534]| whereas the re-acylation of |FRAME:L-1-GLYCEROPHOSPHORYLETHANOL-AMINE| is carried out by the acyl-CoA dependent lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase (ALE1p) |CITS:[17652094] [17726007] [17996202]|. However, the remodeling of |FRAME:CPD-8355| can also be achieved by the enzymatic action of the phospholipases B, i.e PLB1p and PLB2p |CITS:[8051052] [10231538] [10497163] [15588231]| in cooperation with the glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase encoded by GDE1 |CITS:[16141200]| channeling |FRAME:ETHANOL-AMINE| into the Kennedy pathway of phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis (see |FRAME:PWY4FS-6|) which in turn may resupply |FRAME:CPD-8355| or other molecular acyl phosphatidylethanolamine species to the remodeling pathway.

CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3797277232:caspi
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CO-A| (CoA) is a cofactor of ubiquitous occurrence in plants, bacteria, and animals needed in a large number of enzymatic reactions central to intermediary metabolism, including the oxidation of fatty acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. Coenzyme A is the common acyl carrier in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells required for a multitude of reactions for both biosynthetic and degradative pathways amongst others forming derivatives that are key intermediates in energy metabolism |CITS: [16415216]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of CoA is of equal importance with regard to its recognition as a target for antibacterial drug discovery and to the association of human neurodegenerative disorder with mutations in pantothenate kinase |CITS: [15893380]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/CoA is synthesized from |FRAME: PANTOTHENATE| in five enzymatic steps. |FRAME: PANTOTHENATE-KIN-CPLX| first phosphorylates pantothenate to |FRAME: 4-P-PANTOTHENATE|; the enzyme is feedback inhibited by CoA itself, accounting for the primary regulatory mechanism of CoA biosynthesis. The addition of |FRAME: CYS|, resulting in the formation of |FRAME: R-4-PHOSPHOPANTOTHENOYL-L-CYSTEINE| (PPC), is followed by decarboxylation of PPC to |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P|. |FRAME: COADTRI-CPLX| and d|FRAME: EG12312-MONOMER| finally convert 4'-phosphopantetheine to CoA. All enzymes of this pathway are essential for growth.
/
/The reactions in the biosynthetic route towards CoA are identical in most organisms, although there are differences in the functionality of the involved enzymes. In plants every step is catalyzed by single monofunctional enzymes, whereas in bacteria and mammals bifunctional enzymes are often employed |CITS: [16415216]|.
/
/The conversion of |FRAME:R-4-PHOSPHOPANTOTHENOYL-L-CYSTEINE| to |FRAME:PANTETHEINE-P| is catalyzed by |FRAME:CPLX-8646| (PPCDC), a unique heterotrimeric enzyme in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. The PPCDC consists of three genes, i.e. |FRAME:YKL088W|, |FRAME:YKR072C| and |FRAME:YOR054C| which although similar in structure are irreplaceable and fulfill distinctive essential functions in the protein complex. Out of the three genes two, i.e. |FRAME:YKR072C| and |FRAME:YOR054C| are moonlighting proteins which are not only involved as PPCDC subunits in |FRAME:CO-A| biosynthesis |CITS:[19915539]| but also known to be inhibitors/negative regulators of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase Ppz1 in yeast |CITS:[9636153] [11856338] [15192104]|. Hence, this enzyme complex stands as an example of cross-talks between metabolic and signaling pathways indicating the possibility of exerting regulatory influence from one pathway to another |CITS:[19915531]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME:TAX-562| K12 possesses two systems the salvage of |FRAME: Glycerophosphodiesters "glycerophosphoryl diesters"|, the Glp system and the Ugp system. 
/
/In the Glp system, the |FRAME: EG10399| gene encodes a periplasmic glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase (periplasmic GDP) which hydrolyzes deacylated phospholipids to an alcohol and |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P|. The latter is then transported into the cell by the GlpT transporter. Periplasmic GDP is specific for the glycerophospho- moiety of the substrate, while the alcohol can be any one of several alcohols. This provides the cell with the capability of channeling a wide variety of glycerophosphodiesters into the <i>glpQT</i>-encoded dissimilatory system.
/
/In the Ugp system the diesters are hydrolyzed during transport at the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane to |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| and an alcohol by a cytoplasmic GDP, an enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: EG11050| gene. The Ugp system is induced when the cells are starved for inorganic phospate, which is  generates phosphate by the system |CITS: [1851953]|.
/
/In |FRAME:TAX-562| |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| can be further metabolized to |FRAME: DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| by either of two membrane-bound enzymes, depending on the growth conditions. The presumed role of this process is the salvage of glycerol and glycerol phosphates generated by the breakdown of phospholipids and triacylglycerol. Under aerobic conditions, a homodimeric aerobic |FRAME: AERGLYC3PDEHYDROG-CPLX "glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase"| (encoded by the |FRAME: EG10394| gene) is produced, which can accept either oxygen or nitrate as the electron acceptor |CITS: [340460]|. Under anaerobic conditions, a different |FRAME: ANGLYC3PDEHYDROG-CPLX "glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase"| is preferentially expressed. This tri-heteromeric protein complex, which is encoded by the <i>glpACB</i> operon, channels the electrons from |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| to either fumarate or nitrate |CITS: [3286606]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: 4-P-PANTOTHENATE| is the universal precursor for the synthesis of the 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety of |FRAME:CO-A| and |FRAME: ACP "acyl carrier protein"|. Only plants and microorganisms (including some eukaryotic microbes, such as |FRAME: TAX-559292|) can synthesize pantothenate <i>de novo</i> - animals require a dietary supplement. The enzymes of this pathway are therefore considered to be antimicrobial drug targets.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The starting compound for pantothenate biosynthesis, |FRAME: 2-KETO-ISOVALERATE|, is derived from the |FRAME: VALSYN-PWY| pathway. The first committed step in the pathway is the transfer of a methyl group to 2-keto-isovalerate by |FRAME: 3-METHYL-2-OXOBUT-OHCH3XFER-CPLX|. The product of this reaction, |FRAME: 2-DEHYDROPANTOATE|, is subsequently reduced by |FRAME: 2-DEHYDROPANTOATE-REDUCT-MONOMER| to |FRAME: L-PANTOATE|.  The final step is the ATP hydrolysis-dependent condensation of L-pantoate with |FRAME: B-ALANINE| to form |FRAME: PANTOTHENATE|, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: PANTOATE-BETA-ALANINE-LIG-CPLX|.
/
/The enzymes of this pathway are not essential for viability of |FRAME: TAX-83333| grown on media supplemented with pantothenate, due to the presence of a transporter for pantothenate, PanF |CITS: [2193919]|.
/
/<b>This pathway in Yeast</b>
/
/Three out of the four reactions involved in the conversion of |FRAME:2-KETO-ISOVALERATE| to the common intermediate towards |FRAME:CO-A| biosynthesis, i.e. |FRAME:4-P-PANTOTHENATE| have been associated with enzymes in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. The second reaction in the pathway catalyzed by the 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase in bacteria is still elusive for yeast and remains to be resolved. Utilizing genetic and biochemical approaches the functions of |FRAME:MONOMER3O-90| |CITS:[11154694] [16232925] [19266201]|, |FRAME:YIL145C-MONOMER| |CITS:[11154694] [19266201]| and |FRAME:MONOMER3O-268| |CITS:[19266201]| have been elucidated and emphasizes the general notion that the pathway sequences of |FRAME:4-P-PANTOTHENATE| and |FRAME:CO-A| biosynthesis are almost identical among the various kingdoms.  
/
/<b>This Pathway in Plants</b>
/
/Feeding studies in <i>Pisum sativum</i> leaf discs support the existence of a similar biosynthesis pathway of pantothenate via pantoate: when fed with [<sup>14</sup>C]valine, the radiolabel was incorporated into &alpha;-oxoisovalerate, oxopantoate and pantoate |CITS:[jones94]|. A number of enzymes involved in pantothenate biosynthesis have been characterized from different plants, including the enzyme catalyzing the last step of the pathway: pantothenate synthetase. This enzyme catalyzes the formation of pantothenate from pantoate and &beta;-alanine. The origin of plant &beta;-alanine is uncertain but appears to be different from that of bacteria which synthesize it from L-aspartate. Instead plants seem to produce &beta;-alanine from a variety of other sources, like polyamines, uracil and propionate (see |FRAME:PWY-3941|) |CITS: [RAMAN04]|.

COMMENT - Sterols are essential lipids which exist in free and esterified forms in all eukaryotic cells. Only the free amphiphilic sterols are incorporated into membranes whereas steryl esters are of hydrophobic nature (|CITS: [16916618]|) and accumulate in lipid droplets (LD) which serve as storage bodies for neutral lipids in <i>Saccharomyces</i> cells (reviewed in |CITS:[10998572]|). Although steryl ester biosynthesis and lipid body formation appear as important but not essential processes in yeast (|CITS:[11741946]|) a strict control is exercised to maintain the required amount of free sterols (|CITS:[19111628] [3307928]|).
/
/Consequently, steryl ester storage and mobilization is considered significant in sterol homeostasis for the biosynthesis and distribution of the various sterols in yeast such as |FRAME:LANOSTEROL| (see |FRAME:PWY-6132|), |FRAME:ZYMOSTEROL| (see |FRAME:PWY-6074|) and the main sterol |FRAME:ERGOSTEROL| (see |FRAME:PWY-6075|) (|CITS:[18258205] [19111628] [11111085]|). A lack of steryl esters in a quadruple mutant deficient in triacylglycerol synthases (DGA1, LRO1) and ARE1 and 2, the acyl-CoA:sterol acyltransferases in yeast, strongly interfered with the squalene epoxidase ERG1, located upstream of the |FRAME:ERGOSTEROL| biosynthetic route causing reduced incorporation of |FRAME:ERGOSTEROL| into yeast plasma membranes (|CITS:[15155725]|).
/
/An interesting phenomenon has been observed when yeast grows under heme-limiting/anaerobic conditions. Various pairs of isoenzymes involved in the sterol:steryl ester interconversion pathway, such as the steryl ester hydrolases YEH1 and YEH2 and the acyl-CoA:sterol acyltransferases ARE1 and ARE2 behave differently in terms of enzyme and transcriptional activity which may explain the existence of seemingly redundant proteins. 
/
/Under heme-deficient conditions YEH1 was identified as the only steryl ester hydrolase being active under these conditions (|CITS:[15713625]|). The data also indicate a transcriptional control of YEH1 through ROX3, a component of the complex that regulates RNA polymerase II |CITS:[16835446]|. In addition, under conditions of heme-deficiency the acyl-CoA:sterol acyltransferase (ASAT) ARE1 is transcriptionally up-regulated which is regulated by ROX1p in the ARE1 promoter region. Hence, ARE1p is the hypoxic form of the ASAT's which is induced by heme depletion. On the other side ARE2p is the normoxic form of the ASAT's which is induced under aerobic conditions |CITS:[11786267]|. Moreover, ARE1 and ARE2 contribute differentially to the steryl ester formation in the sterol biosynthetic pathway with ARE2p predominantly esterifying |FRAME:ERGOSTEROL| and ARE1p carrying out the esterification of sterol precursors of the pathway such as |FRAME:ZYMOSTEROL| and |FRAME:LANOSTEROL| (|CITS:[8650549] [8798656] [10672016] [11489845]|). Overall a differentially regulated activity of both the steryl ester hydrolases and the ASAT's by the heme status of the cell highlights the adaptability of the pathway and individual impact of the isoenzymes under varying conditions.

COMMENT - The formation of the two heterocyles involved in the biosynthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| (vitamin B1), i.e. the thiazole (see |FRAME:PWY-6908|) and pyrimidine moiety (this pathway), in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> diverge significantly from their bacterial counterparts (see |FRAME:PWY-6892|, |FRAME:PWY-6890|) |CITS:[18161008]|. Whereas the biosynthetic route of the thiazole heterocycle is conserved between plants and fungi, the pyrimidine component, i.e. |FRAME:AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYL-PYR-P| is biosynthesized differently even between plants and fungi |CITS:[12777485] [14570482] [Himmeldirk98] [Ishida08]|.
/
/In dependence on physiological conditions <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> appears to employ two different pathways leading to the pyrimidine moiety of |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|. In the presence of oxygen (aerobic branch - this pathway) radioactive labeling clearly indicated |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE| as a main intermediate in the generation of the pyrimidine heterocycle of |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| |CITS:[8528151] [Ishida08]|. In the absence of oxygen (anaerobic conditions) radioactive |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE| is not incorporated into |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| |CITS:[10706422] [10705981]| and the THI5 gene family, encoding a key enzyme in the aerobic branch of the pyrimidine moiety, is not involved at all |CITS:[12777485]|. However, the pathway has not yet been investigated in detail and remains to be elucidated.
/
/Under aerobic conditions the pathway proceeds from |FRAME:PRPP| |CITS:[6376509]| via |FRAME:CPD-15380| towards |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE|. The exact reaction sequence and corresponding enzymes remain to be demonstrated, however it has been shown that |FRAME:CPD-15380| is a definite intermediate of the pathway |CITS:[11971684]|. From |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE| the biosynthesis of |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE|, a main co-substrate for the HMP-P synthase forming |FRAME:AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYL-PYR-P|, may proceed via different routes. The reaction sequence has not been determined but the enzymes, i.e. pyridoxine/pyridoxal kinase |CITS:[17696614]|, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase |CITS:[Tsuge80] [7896706]| and pyridoxine 4-dehydrogenase/pyridoxal reductase |CITS:[3076441]| have been shown to be involved in the biosynthetic route towards |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|. Several pathways (see |FRAME:PWY-6466|, |FRAME:PWY-6910|) involved in synthesizing |FRAME:AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYL-PYR-P| precursors may feed into the |FRAME:AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYL-PYR-P| pathway |CITS:[10383756] [15614489]| but have been considered salvage or independent pathways with only marginal effects on the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| |CITS:[18028398]|.
/
/A number of authors reported conclusive proofs that |FRAME:HIS| constitutes one of the main components forming |FRAME:AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYL-PYR-P|, however the source of |FRAME:HIS| remained elusive |CITS:[3048267] [8528151] [14570482] [12777485] [Ishida08]|. More recently this puzzle could be resolved by demonstrating in <i>Candida</i> and <i>Saccharomyces</i> that in an unprecedented biochemical process the 4-amino-2-methyl-5-phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase (THI5) catalyzes the last step in the pathway as a single-turnover (suicide) enzyme donating an internal |FRAME:HIS| residue (His-66) to the reaction |CITS:[22568620] [23048037]|.

COMMENT - Alanine is an essential component of protein (as L-alpha-alanine).  
/
/alt1 null mutations demonstrated that under respiratory conditions, the alanine aminotransferase encoded by ALT1 plays a central role in arginine biosynthesis and degradation in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> |CITS: [19396236]|.  Under fermentative conditions, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>  appears to synthesize alanine by an alternative pathway that is independent of Alt1p, but it degrades alanine by the same Alt1p-dependent pathway as used during respiration |CITS: [19396236]|.

COMMENT - Six pathways are now recognized in bacteria, most algae, fungi and higher plants for the biosynthesis of |FRAME: LYS|. They are divided into two groups - the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathways, and the |FRAME:CPD-468| pathways.
/
/In the pathways that belong to the DAP group, lysine is produced from aspartate (along with methionine, threonine and isoleucine). The pathways of the |FRAME: CPD-468| group oriceed via the synthesis of the intermediate |FRAME: CPD-468| (&alpha;-aminoadipate). Two variants of the aminoadipate paThway exist - in yeast and fungi, as well as  |FRAME: TAX-3038|, the pathway continues with the key enzyme |FRAME: YBR115C-MONOMER|, leading to the intermediate |FRAME: SACCHAROPINE| |CITS: [11029074]|, while in prokaryotes the pathway continues in a path similar to bacterial arginine biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PWY-3081|).
/
/The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| synthesizes |FRAME: LYS| via an L-&alpha;-aminoadipate pathway |CITS: [10714900]|. Intermediates in this pathway are often incoporated into secondary metabolites. For example, it has been well-documented that |FRAME: CPD-468| is required for penicillin production (see |FRAME: PWY-5629|) |CITS: [10714900]|.
/
/Regulation of the lysine biosynthetic pathway in |FRAME: TAX-4932| is an interaction between general amino acid control (via |FRAME: G3O-30137 Gcn4p|) |CITS:[Hinnebusch]|, feedback inhibition of |FRAME: EC-2.3.3.14| activity by |FRAME: LYS| |CITS: [10103047]|, and induction of the transcriptional activator |FRAME: G3O-29649 Lys14p| by |FRAME: ALLYSINE| |CITS: [10975256]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Glycogens Glycogen| and |FRAME: Starch|, megadalton-sized glucose polymers, are the major reservoir of readily available energy and carbon compounds in most living organisms, ranging from the archaea, eubacteria and yeasts to the higher eukaryotes, including plants and animals. Only parasites seem to lack enzymes for the metabolism of these compounds |CITS: [12175798]|.
/
/The linkages between the glucose units in glycogen are comprised of approximately 90% &alpha;-1,4 linkages, with the remainder being &alpha;-1,6 branch glucosyl linkages. The average chain length is about 12 to 14 glucose units.
/
/A key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway is glycogen (or starch) synthase. Glycogen and starch synthases are classified in two large and distinct famillies: the mammalian and yeast enzymes utilize |FRAME:CPD-12575| as the glucosyl group donor (see |FRAME: PWY-5067|), while bacterial and plant enzymes prefer |FRAME:ADP-D-GLUCOSE| (see |FRAME:GLYCOGENSYNTH-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-622|). 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glycogen biosynthesis involves three processes: nucleation, elongation, and branching (also known as ramification) |CITS:11152943|. The formation of glycogen begins when either Glg1p or Glg2p uses UDP-glucose to self-glucosylate to produce a short alpha (1,4)-glucosyl chain covalently attached to one of their internal tyrosine residues |CITS:8900126|. After the self-glucosylation of Glg1p or Glg2p, glycogen synthase is able to extend the linear alpha (1,4)-glucosyl chains of glycogen by catalyzing the formation of alpha (1,4)-glucosidic bonds from UDP-
/glucose at the non-reducing ends |CITS:1908457|. Branches can be added into the glycogen molecule by Glc3p, which is the glycogen branching enzyme (EC:2.4.1.18) in S. cerevisiae |CITS:1634552|. No enzyme that releases the glycogen chain from Glg1p or Glg2p has been identified |CITS:11152943|.
/
/Thus far, none of the phenotypes seen in S. cerevisiae glycogen catabolism mutants correspond to the mammalian glycogen storage diseases associated with mutations in human genes involved in glycogen metabolism |CITS:11152943|.

COMMENT - Yeast cells contain 3 pathways for the synthesis of glutamate.  Two pathways are mediated by two isoforms of glutamate dehydrogenase, encoded by GDH1 and GDH3 |CITS: [2989290]||CITS: [9287019]|.  The third pathway is driven by the combined activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase, encoded by GLN1 and GLT1, respectively |CITS: [2570348]||CITS: [8923741]|.  Gln1p catalyzes amination of glutamate to form glutamine; Glt1p then transfers the amide group of glutamine to 2-oxoglutarate, generating two molecules of glutamate.  Glutamate synthase, also referred to as GOGAT, is a trimer of three Glt1p subunits.  Expression of the GLT1 gene is modulated by glutamate-mediated repression and by Gln3p/Gcn4p-mediated activation, depending upon the availability of nitrogen and glutamate in the medium.  In amino acid starvation conditions, GLT1 expression is activated to a moderate degree by Gcn4p |CITS: [9657994]|.

COMMENT - The reactions of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway occur in the cytosol and are important for generating NADPH through the oxidative reduction of NADP+. NADPH is an important source of the reducing energy required by many enzymes in central biosynthetic pathways  |CITS:[8929392]| |CITS:[8910528]| |CITS:[9813062]| |CITS:[11298766]| |CITS:[1628611]|. Although there are other biochemical pathways that generate NADPH in yeast, the pentose phosphate pathway is considered the major source of NADPH, and insufficient NADPH probably contributes to  the fitness defects seen in mutants of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway |CITS:[12047390]| |CITS:[15960801]|. Because NADPH is an essential 
/cofactor for glutathione- and thioredoxin-dependent enzymes that  defend cells against oxidative damage, 
/the oxidative branch of the  pentose phosphate pathway is also important for protecting yeast from 
/oxidative stress |CITS:[8929392]||CITS:[8910528]||CITS:[11557322]||CITS:[16179340]|. 
/
/Metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway varies according to the metabolic needs of the cell |CITS:[10803891]| |CITS:[15066826]|. The first reaction of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway is irreversible, and is the rate limiting reaction for the entire pentose phosphate pathway |CITS:[12047390]|. Although Zwf1p expression in yeast is essentially constitutive |CITS:[16179340]|, Zwf1p activity is inhibited by NADPH and stimulated by processes that decrease the cytosolic levels of NADPH |CITS:[ 3277619]|.

COMMENT - The first five steps of arginine biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae take place in the mitochondrion |CITS: [11553611]||CITS: [Hinnebusch]|. This part of the pathway is known as the acetylated derivatives cycle because the acetyl group that is added to L-glutamate in the first step of the pathway is recycled via N-acetylglutamate generated in the fifth step. The enzymes that catalyze the second and third steps are encoded by a single gene (ARG5,6) that is translated into a pre-protein which is imported into mitochondria and cleaved there to yield two enzymes, N-acetylglutamate kinase and N-acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase |CITS: [1649049]|. These enzymes form a complex with each other and with N-acetylglutamate synthase, the first enzyme in the pathway, which may have implications for regulation of their activity |CITS: [11553611]|.  The mitochondrial steps of the arginine biosynthesis pathway result in the formation of ornithine, which is exported to the cytoplasm by the transporter Ort1p |CITS: [8798783]|. In the cytoplasm, L-ornithine is converted to L-arginine in three reactions mediated by ornithine carbamoyltransferase, arginosuccinate synthase, and argininosuccinate lyase.  Transcription of genes of the arginine biosynthetic pathway, as well as of other amino acid biosynthetic pathways, is activated by the transcription factor Gcn4p under conditions of amino acid starvation |CITS: [11390663]||CITS: [Hinnebusch]|. Transcription of ARG1, ARG3, ARG5,6, and ARG8 is also repressed in the presence of arginine by the ArgR/Mcm1p complex, which consists of Arg80p, Arg81p, Arg82p, and Mcm1p |CITS: [14563547]|. The transcriptional activator Gcn4p interacts with subunits of the ArgR/Mcm1p repressor, allowing for fine-tuning of transcriptional control in response to arginine availability |CITS: [15289616]|.
/
/General Background (from MetaCyc)
/
/Arginine biosynthesis is notable for its complexity and variability at the genetic level, and by its connection with several other pathways, such as pyrimidine and polyamine biosynthesis, and certain degradative pathways. The initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathways proceed via N-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for this is that the acetylation prevents the spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to proline biosynthesis, thus keeping the two pathways separate (|CITS: [12633501]| and references therein).
/
/About This Pathway (from MetaCyc)
/
/The cyclic pathway for arginine biosynthesis has been demonstrated in many organisms, including the prokaryotes Bacillaceae, pseudomonads, cyanobacteria, photosynthetic bacteria and archaebacteria, as well as eukaryotic organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora sp., and Chlamydomonas sp.
/
/Organisms that employ this pathway possess the argJ gene, which encodes the enzyme ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT). OAT catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group from N--acetyl-ornithine to glutamate, generating ornithine and N-acetyl-glutamate (NAG). Since the later is the substrate for another enzyme in this pathway, N-acetyl-glutamate kinase (encoded by argB), which catalyzes a previous step, this reaction effectively converts the otherwise linear pathway to a cyclical pathway |CITS: [8025667 ]|. While most of the NAG in these organisms is generated by OAT, some of it is still generated by N-acetyl-ornithine synthase (NAGS, EC 2.3.1.1, encoded by argA), which fulfils an anaplerotic (replenishment of pathway intermediates) role to replenish NAG that is lost due to degradation or cell division |CITS: [12633501 ]|.
/
/In some bacteria, such as Bacillus sp. |CITS: [8473852 ]|, Nisseria gonorrhoeae |CITS:  [1339419 ]|, Thermotoga neapolitana |CITS: [10931207 ] | and in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) |CITS: [9428669 ]|, OAT can have a dual enzymic function. In these organisms, either N-acetylornithine or acetyl-CoA can be used as acetyl donors for formation of NAG. argJ genes from such organisms can complement both argE and argA mutations in E. coli. However, these organisms still possess separate NAGS enzymes encoded by argA genes. The biological role of duplicate NAGS activity in these organisms remains to be elucidated |CITS: [12633501 ]|.

COMMENT - Formaldehyde is formed by oxidative demethylation reactions in many plants and methylotrophic organisms, but 
/Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a nonmethylotrophic yeast and cannot metabolize methanol to formaldehyde.
/However, S. cerevisiae is exposed to exogenous formaldehyde from plant material or in polluted air and water.
/Concentrations of formaldehyde of 1mM or higher are cytostatic or cytotoxic to haploid wild-type cells.
/
/Any free formaldehyde in vivo spontaneously reacts with glutathione to form S-hydroxymethylglutathione
/|CITS:[12913179]|, |CITS:[8625422]|, |CITS:[10427036]|. The level of enzymes involved in the degradation of formaldehyde, such as Sfa1p and Yjl068p,
/determine the level of formaldehyde toxicity, and cells overproducing Sfa1p are resistant to formaldehyde and null
/mutants in either sfa1 or yjl068c are hypersensitive to formaldehyde. Sfa1p is induced in response to chemicals

COMMENT - Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine proceeds via a common pathway to chorismate, at which point the pathway branches |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  One branch proceeds to tryptophan, and the other to tyrosine and phenylalanine |CITS:[Jones]|.  The series of reactions to chorismate, called the shikimate pathway, and the series of reactions from chorismate to tryptophan have been found to be common to all eukaryotes and prokaryotes studied thus far (as reported in |CITS:[1943992]|). In contrast, there appears to be two separate routes from chorismate to tyrosine and phenylalanine, only one of which has been found in S. cerevisiae |CITS:[1943992]|.
/
/Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition, activation of enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis |CITS:[Jones][1943992]|.  The first step in the tryptophan branch is feedback inhibited by tryptophan, and the first step in the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine and activated by tryptophan |CITS:[1943992]|.  The transcriptional activator GCN4 regulates most of the genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes; however, no GCN4 regulation was found for TRP1 of the tryptophan branch, TYR1 of the tyrosine branch or ARO7 of the tyrosine and phenylalanine branch |CITS:[1943992]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID Lipoate| is an essential sulfur-containing cofactor of various multienzyme complexes and responsible in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> for the lipoylation of the E2 subunits of three mitochondrial proteins, i.e. pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), &alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) and the glycine cleavage enzyme (GCV) |CITS:[2007123] [19570983]|. Those enzymes have been shown to play pivotal roles in mitochondrial maintenance and respiratory growth |CITS:[10839818] [20226757]|. Moreover, a protective role of |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID| against hydrogen peroxide has been reported indicating its properties as antioxidant and antimutagenic agent |CITS:[14599473]|.  
/
/Fatty acid biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms is carried out in independent, dual cellular locations, the cytosol with fatty acid synthase (FAS) complexes (FAS I type) synthesizing fatty acids (for example |FRAME:PWY-5994|) and the mitochondria where monofunctional enzymes catalyze the various steps of fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS II type) |CITS:[19028688]|. The latter resembles the bacterial FAS II system (see |FRAME:PWY0-501|, |FRAME:PWY0-1275|) but except for |FRAME:CPD-195|, the precursor for |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID| (compare |FRAME:PWY-7388|), the functions of other final products made by the pathway remain unclear and require further research |CITS:[19028688]|.
/
/This pathway describes the lipoylation of the E2 subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the &alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), and the glycine cleavage system (GCV). The first two enzymes catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of glycolysis end product |FRAME:PYRUVATE| and TCA cycle intermediate |FRAME:2-KETOGLUTARATE|, respectively, hence connecting cytosolic glycolysis with mitochondrial respiration.
/
/Octanoylated |FRAME: G3O-28852-MONOMER| (|FRAME: G3O-163|) acts as a checkpoint for the |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID| biosynthesis and incorporation, and is required for lipoate attachment to all three proteins, although the purpose and mechanism of this checkpoint is not well understood |CITS:[19570983][23960015]|.
/
/Once all |FRAME: G3O-163| molecules have been octanoylated a so far elusive octanoyl-[acp]:CoA transferase carries out the formation of |FRAME:CPD-196| from |FRAME: Octanoyl-ACPs octanoyl-[acp]|. |FRAME:CPD-196 Octanoyl-CoA| has been found to be the substrate for the octanoyl-CoA:protein transferase (LIP3, also referred to as AIM22), which transfers the octanoyl group to both the E2 subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase (LAT1) and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGD2), respectively, forming the corresponding octanoylated proteins  |CITS:[19570983] [23960015]|. In the following step of the pathway a mitochondrial lipoyl synthase (LIP5) catalyzes the insertion of two sulfur into |FRAME:CPD-195| |CITS:[8349643] [11106496]|, hence forming the lipoylated PDH and KGDH molecules.

COMMENT - Saccharomyces cerevisiae can grow on acetoin and 2,3-butanediol as the sole carbon and energy sources, indicating S. cerevisiae's ability to degrade these metabolites |CITS: [10938079]|.  Acetoin and 2,3-butanediol are both by-products of alcoholic fermentation by S. cerevisiae and other wine yeasts.  Various lines of evidence suggest that Bdh1p catalyzes the first step in 2,3-butanediol degradation, the oxidation of 2,3-butanediol to acetoin |CITS: [10938079]|.  However, S. cerevisiae mutants with a disrupted BDH1 gene can still grow on 2,3-butanediol as the sole carbon and energy source, indicating that there are other enzymes that can metabolize 2,3-butanediol |CITS: [10938079]|).  How acetoin is further degraded in S. cerevisiae is not yet known.  Many prokaryotes have a multienzyme complex, acetoin dehydrogenase , that is similar to pyruvate dehdrogenase and transforms acetoin into acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, which can enter the glyoxylate and TCA cycle (as reported in |CITS: [11306064]|).

COMMENT - Many yeast and bacterial species ferment pyruvate to 2,3-butanediol via the intermediate, acetoin.  Although acetoin is a flavorless compound, it is a precursor to some off-odor compounds, such as diacetyl, which can be unfavorable in beer and wine.  Acetoin and 2,3-butanediol are both by-products of alcoholic fermentation by S. cerevisiae and other wine yeasts. Acetoin production during alcoholic fermentation depends on the yeast strain and other variables such as substrate and temperature (as reported in |CITS: [16535224]|). Wine yeasts with high fermentation power generally produce low acetoin levels and large amounts of ethanol and higher alcohols (alcohols with more than 2 carbons) (as reported in |CITS: [16535224]|).

COMMENT - Phosphatidate (PA) is a central metabolite for the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols and major phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), the latter being synthesized through the metabolization of PA via the CDP-diacylglycerol pathway (see |FRAME:PWY-5667|) |CITS:[20332534]|. Phosphatidate is known to be synthesized in yeast |CITS:[10049376] [9401016]| and mammals |CITS:[9370313]| by two pathways, one pathway takes the route via |FRAME:GLYCEROL-3P| (G3P) (see |FRAME:PWY3O-6499|) and the other pathway produces phosphatidate through |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| (DHAP) (see |FRAME:PWY3O-6407|). 
/
/The impact of phosphatidate on the regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis has been under investigation for some time. It could be demonstrated that the transcriptional regulation of gene expression in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is subject to the content of phosphatidate in the cell which controls the biochemistry of enzymes active in the synthesis of phospholipids |CITS:[21275641]|. The formation of diacylglycerol (DAG), a precursor for triacylglycerol (TAG) and phospholipid biosynthesis, is catalyzed both by the triacylglycerol lipase TGL4 |CITS:[16135509]| and phosphatidate phosphatase PAH1 |CITS:[2542283]|, the former catalyzing the degradation of TAG and the latter forming DAG by dephosphorylation of phosphatidate (PA). Both enzymes are regulated in their activity through a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK1/CDC28) which phosphorylates both enzymes resulting in the activation of TGL4 and inactivation of PAH1 indicating their control of the flux in the DAG/TAG pathway, the gateway to phospholipids synthesis |CITS:[19150427] [22910056]|. 
/
/In the G3P pathway |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| is reduced to |FRAME:GLYCEROL-3P| which is catalyzed by the NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase encoded in yeast by GPD1 |CITS:[1499720]|. |FRAME:GLYCEROL-3P Glycerol-3-phosphate| is then the substrate for the two enzymes expressing dual glycerol-3-phosphate <i>O</i>-acyltransferase/dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase activity, i.e. SCT1p and GPT2p |CITS:[11544256]| which results in the formation of an lyso-phosphatidate. In the DHAP branch the latter enzymes also catalyze the esterification of  |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| with a fatty acid forming a lyso-glycerone phosphate which is subsequently reduced by the 1-acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate reductase encoded by AYR1 |CITS:[10617610]| yielding the corresponding lyso-phosphatidate. In the last step of the pathway lyso-phosphatidate undergoes another acylation which forms the key product for phospholipid biosynthesis, i.e. phosphatidate. Because of the central metabolic position of phosphatidate it is not unexpected that many of the lyso-phospholipid acyltransferases accept lyso-phosphatidate, e.g. |FRAME:L-1-LYSOPHOSPHATIDATE| as substrate and re-esterify it to the corresponding phosphatidate molecular species, e.g. |FRAME:CPD-8268| with varying efficiency. Besides the triacylglycerol lipases TGL4p |CITS:[16135509] [16267052] [20332534]| and TGL5p |CITS:[16135509] [20016004]| which also demonstrated oleoyl-CoA:lysophosphatidate acyltransferase (LPAT) activity the major LPATs in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> are SLC1p |CITS:[8408076] [1767529]| and LOA1p |CITS:[22090344]| which have both a dual location at the endoplasmatic reticulum and lipid droplets in the yeast cell.

The many different phospholipid molecular species found in yeast basically vary in their composition of fatty acids esterified to the sn-1 and sn-2 position of a phosphorylated |FRAME:GLYCEROL| and a head group which can either be a |FRAME:CHOLINE|, |FRAME:ETHANOL-AMINE|, |FRAME:SER|, |FRAME:MYO-INOSITOL| or the one phospholipid without a head group, i.e. phosphatidate (for example |FRAME:CPD-8291|) |CITS:[14321173] [22345606]|. After the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of phospholipids in the Kennedy pathway (see |FRAME:TRIGLSYN-PWY|, |FRAME:PWY3O-450|) glycerophospholipids can be degraded (see |FRAME:LIPAS-PWY|, |FRAME:LIPASYN-PWY-1|) and remodeled (this pathway; see also |FRAME:PWY-7409| and |FRAME:PWY-7417|). The latter has been proposed by William E.M. Lands |CITS:[14413818]| who describes in the eponymous 'Lands cycle' a de-acylation-re-acylation process of phospholipids typically characterized by saturated acyl chains at the sn-1 and unsaturated acyl chains at the sn-2 position |CITS:[7871882]|.
/
/This remodeling process starts with the de-acylation at the sn-2 position of phospholipids catalyzed by phospholipases (e.g. phospholipase A2) generating the corresponding lyso-phospholipids. The resulting lyso-phospholipids represent the substrates for acyl-CoA dependent lyso-phospholipid acyltransferases or phospholipid transacylases which can re-acylate the sn-2 position. Generally, the Lands cycle constitutes an exchange of fatty acids at the sn-2 position which is an substantial factor in the maintenance of the homeostasis of phospholipids |CITS:[17010666]|. This de- and re-acylation process translates into many physiological functions, for example increasing membrane fluidity through a higher percentage of unsaturated acyl chains, re-esterification of exogenous lyso-phospholipids |CITS:[17726007]|, buffering excess toxic fatty acids |CITS:[22090344] [19608739]| and maintenance of the intrinsic membrane curvature necessary to preserve membrane integrity |CITS:[16339082] [31173]|.
/
/Phosphatidate (PA) is a central metabolite for the biosynthesis of major phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) because they are synthesized through the metabolization of PA via the CDP-diacylglycerol pathway (see |FRAME:PWY-5667|) |CITS:[20332534]|. It is not unexpected therefore that many of the lyso-phospholipid acyltransferases accept lyso-phosphatidate, e.g. |FRAME:L-1-LYSOPHOSPHATIDATE| as substrate and re-esterify it to the corresponding phosphatidate molecular species, e.g. |FRAME:CPD-8268| with varying efficiency. Besides the triacylglycerol lipases TGL4p |CITS:[16135509] [16267052] [20332534]| and TGL5p |CITS:[16135509] [20016004]| which also demonstrated oleoyl-CoA:lysophosphatidate acyltransferase (LPAT) activity the major LPATs in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> are SLC1p |CITS:[8408076] [1767529]| and LOA1p |CITS:[22090344]| which have both a dual location at the endoplasmatic reticulum and lipid droplets in the yeast cell. The reverse reaction, i.e. deacylation of phosphatidate by a phospholipase A2 activity as shown for TGL4p is possible but remains to be shown.

COMMENT - Fatty acids are essential to all organisms except for archaea; they are major constituents of cellular membranes, and are used for energy storage and for posttranslational protein modifications. Most organisms are capable of synthesizing long chain (C12:0-C16:0) saturated fatty acids de novo.  Although the initiation and termination reactions may vary, the cyclic series of chain-lengthening reactions are essentially the same across all organisms. The fatty acid chain, which starts as a 2-carbon chain from acetyl-CoA, is extended two carbons at a time by the addition of an acetyl group from malonyl-CoA.  When the final length of the fatty acid is achieved, fatty acid synthesis is terminated.  Each cycle of chain elongation involves 5 reactions with the following enzymatic activities: malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39), ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41), ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100), 3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61), and enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10). In yeast, fatty acid biosynthesis is terminated with the release of fatty acyl-CoAs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme complex that carries out de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.  Palmitoyl- (C16) and stearoyl-CoA (C18) are the main products in yeast, while myristoyl-CoA (C14) is only produced in small amounts |CITS: [Lynen69]|. To synthesize palmitoyl-CoA (C16) one acetyl-CoA and 7 malonyl-CoA molecules are required.  The elongation substrate, malonyl-CoA is synthesized from the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (EC 6.4.1.2) by the biotin-containing enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p) |CITS: [1350093]|).  Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by the biotin:apoprotein ligase (Bpl1p) |CITS: [7649444]|). 
/
/There are two types of FAS systems based on the organization of the catalytic sites. Fungi, animals, and some bacteria have type I FASs, which are large multi-functional proteins that contain all of the requisite catalytic active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis within domains on a single polypeptide (alpha) or on two polypeptides (alpha and beta). Fungal FASs are alpha6beta6 heterododecamers, animal FASs are alpha2 homodimers, and some type I bacterial FASs are alpha6  |CITS: [17448991]|. Bacteria, plants and mitochondria, on the other hand, have type II FAS systems, which are comprised of independent proteins, whereby each protein catalyzes a single step in the cyclic series of reactions |CITS: [15952903]|.
/
/The yeast FAS complex catalyzes a total of 8 reactions. The alpha subunit(Fas2p) catalyzes 3 reactions, ketoacyl synthase (EC: 2.3.1.41),ketoacyl reductase (EC: 1.1.1.100) and self pantetheinylation and the yeast beta subunit (Fas1p) catalyzes 5 reactions, acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.38), malonyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.39),3-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (EC: 4.2.1.58, 4.2.1.59, and 4.2.1.61),enoyl-acyl reductase (EC: 1.3.1.10), and palmitoyl transferase (EC:2.3.1.-) |CITS: [365179], [1100391], [10785388], [3528750], [374077]|.
/
/FASs are regulated at the transcriptional and translational level as well as posttranslationally.  In yeast, FAS is a housekeeping enzyme that is expressed constitutively at a low level, but its expression is also activated by the general yeast transcription factors Rap1, Abf1 and Reb1 |CITS: [7925441]| and theinositol/choline-responsive transcription factor heterodimer, Ino2p-Ino4p |CITS: [1461729][7862526]|. The coordinate expression of the two subunits also appears to be regulated by Fas1p controlling the expression of FAS2 |CITS: [11713312]|. The FAS subunits are further regulated by proteolytic degradation of excess subunits. While the intact FAS multimeric complex (alpha6beta6 ) is stable, its individual subunits are rapidly degraded |CITS: [1735446][8262967]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamine diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|, |FRAME: CPLX3O-118 "pyruvate decarboxylase"|, and |FRAME: CPLX66-42 "&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase"| |CITS:[15326535]|. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the |FRAME: THIAMINE|-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|. Thiamine is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820 <i>Plasmodium</i>|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-P "Thiamine phosphate"| is formed by the coupling of two moieties, the pyrimidine |FRAME:AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP| and the thiazole |FRAME: THZ-P|, which are produced by two different pathways. This pathway describes the formation of the thiazole moiety in eukaryotes.
/
/Genetic studies in |FRAME: TAX-4932| have demonstrated that |FRAME: G3O-154| is the only gene required for thiamine thiazole formation |CITS: [7941734]|. The donor of the sulfur that is incorporated was elusive for a long time. It has been shown that |FRAME: G3O-154| promotes a very unusual chemical reaction in which it acts as a co-substrate and supplies the sulfur through an iron-dependent transfer from an internal cysteine amino acid residue (Cys-205). The reaction converts Cys-205 to |FRAME:2-AMINOACRYLATE| and renders THI4 inactive. Hence, THI4 represents a single-turnover (suicide) enzyme |CITS:[22031445]|. Another single-turnover enzyme, i.e. |FRAME:CPLX-8694| (THI5), is involved in the pyrimidine moiety formation in |FRAME: TAX-4932| (see |FRAME:PWY-7282|).
/
/When expressed in |FRAME: TAX-562|, the enzyme copurified with its product (|FRAME: CPDQT-400 "adenylated thiazole"|) and two additional adenylated intermediates that shed light on its complex mechanism |CITS: [18652458]|. Similarly, in the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| the multifunctional protein |FRAME: AT5G54770| is sufficient for thiazole production. While it has been shown that NAD and |FRAME: GLY| are substrates for the enzyme, the exact source of sulfur is still not known.

COMMENT - |FRAME:GLUTATHIONE Glutathione| represents an ubiquitous thiol-containing tripeptide which occurs in almost all eukaryotes |CITS:[3657565]|. It is regarded as an important cell redox buffer, has been shown to play pivotal roles in iron metabolism, is involved in detoxification processes of endogenous toxins and xenobiotics, and provides resistance against heavy metals and oxidative stress (summarized in |CITS:[12702279] [12809732]|. In addition, |FRAME:GLUTATHIONE| is a valuable cell resource for sulfur and nitrogen |CITS:[6137189]| and integrated in the complex network of protein regulation via S-glutathionylation |CITS:[24396728]|.
/
/The maintenance of |FRAME:GLUTATHIONE| homeostasis in the cell is critical in terms of protection against a wide range of stress factors and the normal function of numerous cell processes. Consequently, biosynthesis and degradation of |FRAME:GLUTATHIONE| which is summarized in the |FRAME:PWY-4041| is tightly regulated |CITS:[22170048]|. However, it appears that in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> this cycle is truncated and several enzymes of the |FRAME:PWY-4041| do not operate in <i>Saccharomyces</i> |CITS:[Jaspers85]|. Only the vacuolar &gamma;-glutamyl transpeptidase encoded by ECM38 had been characterized and found to be able to degrade |FRAME:GLUTATHIONE| (see |FRAME:PWYQT-4432|), and had been consequently considered to be the main player in the catabolic part of |FRAME:GLUTATHIONE| metabolism |CITS:[6102906] [6143574] [11672438]|. 
/
/However, a new pathway operating in the cytosol and coined DUG (<u><b>D</b></u>efective in <u><b>U</b></u>tilization of <u><b>G</b></u>lutathione) (this pathway) was identified |CITS:[17179087] [12620619]| and appears to be the only pathway involved in |FRAME:GLUTATHIONE| homeostasis by degrading |FRAME:GLUTATHIONE| in <i>Saccharomyces</i> |CITS:[22170048]| but also in <i>Candida</i> |CITS:[21994941]|. Three genes, i.e. DUG1, DUG2 and DUG3 encode for the set of reactions which convert |FRAME:GLUTATHIONE| into |FRAME:CYS| progressively releasing |FRAME:GLT| and |FRAME:GLY|. The first enzyme, i.e. glutathione hydrolase is interesting with regard to the interactions taking place between the two involved enzymes - DUG2p and DUG3p. DUG2p belongs to the M20A family of metallopeptidases and does not exhibit any catalytic activity. However, it serves as an scaffolding enzyme binding DUG3p, an enzyme with an functional glutamine amidotransferase II domain (N-terminal hydrolase enzyme family) and building an degradosomal complex (DUG2p-DUG3p)2 which only in this form is able to degrade |FRAME:GLUTATHIONE| yielding |FRAME:CYS-GLY| under release of |FRAME:GLT| |CITS:[17179087] [22277648]|. The subsequent reaction, the cleavage of |FRAME:CYS-GLY| forming |FRAME:CYS| and |FRAME:GLY| is catalyzed by the CYS-GLY metallopeptidase encoded by DUG1 |CITS:[17179087] [19346245]|. Whereas the DUG2-DUG3 genes are transcriptional regulated and dependent on the availability of sulfur, DUG1 is constitutively expressed and independent of sulfur supply. Overall, biochemical and genetic evidence confirms the involvement of the DUG pathway in the cellular homeostasis of |FRAME:GLUTATHIONE| and sulfur |CITS:[22277648]|.

COMMENT - Although proline is the least-preferred nitrogen source for many lab strains of S. cerevisiae, it is the most abundant source of nitrogen in grapes, the natural environment of wild yeast |CITS: [10629046]|. When other sources of nitrogen like ammonia, asparagine or glutamine are unavailabe, S. cerevisiae degrade proline into glutmate via the proline utilization pathway in the mitochondria |CITS:[387737]|, |CITS:[387738]|. This degradation is catalyzed by proline oxidase and delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, which are encoded by the nuclear genes PUT1 and PUT2 respectively |CITS: [3537723]|, |CITS: [ 6358862]|.  Both PUT1 and PUT2 are positively regulated by the transcriptional activator Put3p |CITS:[14517252]|. Although Put3p is bound constitutively to the promoters of PUT1 and PUT2, transcriptional upregulation only occurs in the presense of proline and absence of a preferred nitrogen source |CITS:[10629046]|, |CITS:[1986247]|. PUT1 is also positively regulated by the GATA factors Gln3p and Nil1p/Gat1p |CITS: [7891726]|, |CITS:[12796300]|. The presence of a good nitrogen source, such as ammonia or glutamine, supresses the proline utilization pathway-an effect known as nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) |CITS: [10640599]|. The transcription factors responsible for PUT1 and PUT2 repression by NCR are Ure2p, Dal80p, and Nil2p |CITS:[8416910]|, |CITS:[9171427]|.

TYPES - Tetrapyrrole-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - tetrapyrrole biosynthesis II (from glycine)
CITATIONS - 7597845:EV-EXP-IDA:3812905950:caspi
COMMENT - Tetrapyrroles, such as heme, siroheme, chlorophyll, and cobalamin (vitamin B12) function as cofactors in a variety of essential biological processes.  Tetrapyrroles are comprised of four pyrrole rings linked together  by single-carbon bridges in a linear or cyclic fashion. The cyclic tetrapyrroles heme and siroheme contain an iron-atom coordinated in their central cavity and function in respiration and sulfur assimilation, respectively.  <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> synthesize heme and siroheme <i>de novo</i> via a common pathway up to the intermediate uroporphyrinogen III; oxidative decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen III leads to the synthesis of heme while its methylation leads to siroheme synthesis.
/
/The first committed precursor in the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles is the 5-carbon compound 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) |CITS: [2077690]|.  Animals, fungi, apicomplexan protozoa (such as the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>) and photosynthetic bacteria, synthesize ALA from succinyl CoA and glycine |CITS: [2789025][15144063]|, while higher plants and other bacteria (including <i>Escherichia coli</I>) synthesize ALA from glutamate |CITS: [2789025][2077690]|. 
/
/In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, HEM1 encodes for ALA synthase, the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles |CITS: [6381051]|. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is an essential factor for Hem1p |CITS: [6381051]|. The second step, the condensation of ALA to form the pyrrole porphobilinogen, is catalyzed by ALA dehydratase (also known as porphobilinogen synthase; EC 4.2.1.24), a homo-octameric enzyme encoded by HEM2 |CITS: [2204246]|. Hem3p and Hem4p catalyze the third and fourth steps, respectively. HEM3 encodes for porphobilinogen 
/deaminase (also known as hydroxymethylbilane synthase; EC 2.5.1.61), the enzyme catalyzing the condensation of four molecules of 4-porphobilinogen to form the linear tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane |CITS: [1508149]|, and HEM4 encodes for uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS; EC 4.2.1.75), the enzyme catalyzing the cyclization of hydroxymethylbilane and rearrangement of the fourth pyrrole to form the important intermediate uroporphyrinogen III |CITS: [7597845]|. In the absence of UROS, the linear tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane undergoes non-enzymatic cyclization without rearrangement of the fourth pyrrole ring to form uroporphyrinogen I, which is not an intermediate in the synthesis of biological tetrapyrroles. Uroporphyrinogen III is a major branch point intermediate leading to biosynthesis of different tetrapyrrole-derived compounds, such as siroheme, heme, cobalamin (vitamin B12), and the methanogenic coenzyme F430 |CITS: [2077690]|.  <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is not believed to synthesize cobalamin de novo |CITS: [9003798][10051442]|.

COMMENT - While Saccharomyces cerevisiae can use most amino acids as their sole nitrogen source, they can only use a few amino acids as a carbon source to support growth |CITS:[Large86][Cooper82]|.  This is in contrast to most eukaryotes and some fungi, which can metabolize amino acids completely, utilizing them as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen |CITS:[Stryer88][Large 86]|. S. cerevisiae degrade the aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan) and branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and iso-leucine) via the Ehrlich pathway |CITS:[Sentheshanmuganathan60][10989420]|.  This pathway is comprised of the following steps:  1) deamination of the amino acid to the corresponding alpha-keto acid; 2) decarboxylation of the resulting alpha-keto acid to the respective aldehyde; and, 3) reduction of the aldehyde to form the corresponding long chain or complex alcohol, known as a fusel alcohol or fusel oil |CITS:[10989420][Large 86]|.  Fusel alcohols are important flavor and aroma compounds in yeast-fermented food products and beverages (as reported in |CITS:[9546164]|.
/
/Both the constitutive aromatic aminotransferase I (ARO8p) and the inducible aromatic aminotransferase II (ARO9p) can catalyze the initial reaction in tyrosine degradation |CITS:[ 6763508]|.  In vitro studies demonstrated that Aro9p is active with phenylpyruvate, pyruvate, or p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, but not 2-oxoglutarate as the amino acceptor, while Aro8p is active with phenylpyruvate, pyruvate, or 2-oxoglutarate |CITS:[6763508]|.  Aro9p is induced by aromatic amino acids and is subject to nitrogen regulation |CITS:[6763508][10207060]|.

COMMENT - The tripeptide glutathione (GSH: L-&gamma;-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) is a prevalent intracellular thiol that is able to act as a cellular redox buffer due to its low redox potential (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|). GSH is involved in many biological processes including: protein and DNA synthesis; amino acid transport; enzyme regulation; protection of cells against reactive oxygen compounds and free radicals, xenobiotics and heavy metals (as reviewed in |CITS: [12702279]|). GSH can also be used as a source of sulfur and cysteine in |CITS: [1674526], [10514563]|.
/
/Although GSH biosynthesis is well characterized in yeast, the pathway(s) of GSH degradation are not yet fully characterized. Plants and animals are known to metabolize GSH via the &gamma;-glutamyl cycle, but the presence of this complete cycle in yeast and other microorganisms is still open to debate |CITS: [5076], [JASPERS85]|. 
/
/<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is believed to hydrolyze GSH to its constitutive amino acids glutamate, cysteine and glycine in two steps catalyzed by the vacuolar-membrane-bound enzymes, &gamma;-glutamyl transpeptidase (Ecm38p) and cysteinylglycine dipeptidase (CGase), respectively |CITS: [JASPERS85], [6143574], [11672438]|. 
/Ecm38p catalyzes the cleavage and transfer of the &gamma;-glutamyl moiety from GSH to an acceptor amino acid (or its hydrolysis to glutamate) and the release of cysteinylglycine |CITS: [JASPERS85]|. Cellular levels of Ecm38p are low in the presence of ammonium ions as the sole nitrogen source, 
/but they are increased in the presence of other nitrogen sources, such as amino acids and urea |CITS: [6102906]|. Ecm38p production is derepressed during nitrogen starvation |CITS: [9202464]|. CGase is proposed to hydrolyze the cysteinylglycine to the amino acids cysteine and glycine.  Although enzymatic activity for CGase was observed in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> |CITS: [JASPERS85]|, the open reading frame for CGase has yet to be identified in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. 
/
/<i>S. cerevisiae</i> also has been proposed to have an alternative pathway for degrading GSH that involves a novel GSH degradosomal protein complex comprised of the three gene products Dug1p, Dug2p, and Dug3p |CITS: [17179087]|.

COMMENT - <u>Preliminary note</u>
/
/It should be noted that |FRAME:CPD-1789| has been mistakenly called D-erythroascorbic acid (D-erythroascorbate) in the literature which has been remedied by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) in May 2008.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of |FRAME:CPD-1789| from |FRAME:D-ARABINOSE| has been observed in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and other fungi |CITS:[10802179] [11281285]|. Since the occurrence of |FRAME:CPD-1789| has been reported in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and the fungus <i> Lypomyces starkeyi</i> |CITS:[Nick86]| its physiological function has been a matter of debate. |FRAME:CPD-1789 Dehydro-D-arabinono-1,4-lactone| is an analog of |FRAME:ASCORBATE| which performs a number of important functions in plants and animals such as an antioxidant, co-factor for Fe-containing enzymes, electron acceptor and controller of developmental processes (reviewed in |CITS:[Loewus99] [11153268]|. 
/
/
/Although the existence of |FRAME:ASCORBATE| has been reported in yeast |CITS:[4555845]| and the capability of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> demonstrated to synthesize vitamin C under certain conditions |CITS:[10802179]| it is widely acknowledged that <i>Saccharomyces</i> produces |FRAME:CPD-1789| instead. The similarity in molecule structure, pathway sequence and catalyzing enzymes between |FRAME:ASCORBATE| biosynthesis (see for example |FRAME:PWY4FS-11|) and |FRAME:PWY3O-6| has prompted the isolation, purification and characterization of the corresponding enzymes.  
/
/The first step in the pathway is catalyzed by D-arabinose dehydrogenase (ARA). There are two D-arabinose dehydrogenases characterized in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the NADP+-dependent enzyme ARA1 |CITS:[9920381] [17151466]| and the NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase ARA2 |CITS:[17097644]|, the latter characterized as the main contributor in the production of |FRAME:CPD-1789|. The final step in the pathway, the oxidation of |FRAME:CPD-356| yielding |FRAME:CPD-1789| is carried out by the D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase (ALO1) |CITS:[10094636] [369458] [10508108]|. 
/
/The physiological significance of |FRAME:CPD-1789| in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and other fungi is not clear yet and further research is needed to resolve the question. However, it has been shown that |FRAME:CPD-1789| acts as an antioxidant |CITS:[10094636] [10508108]|, has shown vitamin C activity |CITS:[Shao93]| and is therefore considered as a fungal compound with similar properties as |FRAME:ASCORBATE| has in plants and animals.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes convert 2-oxo acids to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives and produce NADH and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| in an irreversible reaction.
/Five members of this family are known at present, including the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY "pyruvate dehydrogenase complex"| (PDHC - this pathway), the |FRAME: PWY-5084 "2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex"| (OGDHC), the |FRAME: PWY-5046 "branched-chain &alpha;-keto acid dehydrogenase complex"| (BCDHC), the |FRAME: GLYCLEAV-PWY "glycine cleavage complex"| (GDHC), and the |FRAME: CPLX-7659| (ADHC). They all function at strategic points in (usually aerobic) catabolic pathways and are subject to stringent control |CITS: [9655933]|.
/
/With the exception of GDHC, the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes share a common structure. They consist of three main components, namely a 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (E1), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3).
/In Gram-positive bacteria and mitochondria, the E1 component is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, while in Gram-negative bacteria it is made of a single type of subunit.
/
/In all cases described so far, many copies of each subunit assemble to form the full complex. For example, the |FRAME: TAX-83333| |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX| comprises 24, 24, and 12 units of the E1, E2, and E3 components, respectively.
/The core of the complex is made of either 24 (Gram-negative bacteria) or 60 (mitochondria) E2 units, which contain the lipoyl active site in the form of lipoyllysine, as well as binding sites for the other two subunits. E1, which contains a |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| cofactor, catalyzes the binding of the 2-oxo acid to the lipoyl group of E2, which then transfers an acyl group (the nature of the acyl group depends on the particular enzyme) to |FRAME: CO-A|, forming an acyl-CoA. During this transfer, the lipoyl group is reduced to dihydrolipoyl. E3 then transfers the protons to NAD, forming NADH and restoring the dihydrolipoyllysine group back to lipoyllysine.
/
/Cryoelectron microscopy of PDHC from |FRAME: TAX-1422| |CITS:[12411477]| and ox kidney |CITS: [11752427]| has revealed that the E2 inner core is surrounded by an outer shell of E1 and E3 components, with the lipoyl domains confined to the annular space between them where they must make successive journeys between the three types of active sites (E1-E3), which are physically far apart |CITS: [12795594]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In the pathway illustrated here, |FRAME: PYRUVATE| is converted to |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|, a key reaction of central metabolism, which links the substrate-level phosphorylation pathway |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis| (which ends with the generation of |FRAME: PYRUVATE|) to the |FRAME: TCA "TCA cycle"|, which accepts the input of |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|.
/
/The |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX|, which in |FRAME:TAX-562| consists of 24 E1 subunits, 24 E2 subunits, and 12 E3 subunits, catalyzes three reactions that constitute a cycle.  The three reactions can be summarized by the reaction
/
/|FRAME:PYRUVDEH-RXN|.
/
/During aerobic growth of |FRAME:TAX-562| the cycle is an essential source of |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| to feed the |FRAME: TCA| and thereby to satisfy the cellular requirements for the precursor metabolites it forms. Mutant strains defective in the complex require an exogenous source of |FRAME: ACET| during aerobic growth, but not under anaerobic conditions,since during anaerobic growth pyruvate formate lyase generates |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| from |FRAME: PYRUVATE|.  Mutant strains lacking pyruvate formate lyase have the reverse phenotype |CITS: [ecosal]|.
/
/In some strains of |FRAME: TAX-2104| the multienzyme complex reaction is part of an alternate path from phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate |CITS: [8948633] [9439886][3141576]|.
/
/Plants have two forms of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, one in the plastid and the other in the mitochondrion. The two complexes have distinct physiological roles. The plastid pyruvate dehydrogenase complex provides the main acetyl-CoA source for <i>de novo</i> fatty acid biosynthesis (|FRAME:PWY-4381|). The mitochondrial complex provides acetyl-CoA 
/for the |FRAME: TCA| cycle and NADH for oxidative phosphorylation. Both complexes are feedback inhibited by acetyl-CoA and NADH. However the two complexes differ in other aspects of enzyme characteristics. The mitochondrial complex but not the plastid one is regulated by phosphorylation. The plastid complex requires higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration and more alkaline pH for maximal enzyme activity |CITS: [12631264]|.
/
/The yeast pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is encoded by five genes. It consists of the pyruvate dehydrogenase component (comprising two types of subunits - the E1&alpha; subunit |FRAME: YER178W| and the E1&beta; subunit |FRAME: YBR221C|, dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase (E2 subunit, |FRAME: YNL071W|), dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3 subunit, |FRAME: YFL018C|), and a fifth subunit (protein X, |FRAME: YGR193C|) which links |FRAME: YNL071W| to |FRAME: YFL018C|.

COMMENT - RNA modification is a post-transcriptional process by which certain nucleotides are altered after their initial incorporation into an RNA chain.
/The most heavily modified class of RNA molecules is the tRNA - an average of 11%, 14%, and 17% of the tRNA residues are modified in |FRAME: TAX-562|, |FRAME: TAX-4932|, and mammalian cytoplasm, respectively |CITS: [9399820]|. These modifications expand the chemical and functional diversity of tRNA, and enhance its structural stability |CITS: [3304135]|.
/In some bacterial genomes, about 1% of the coding genes are devoted to tRNA modification |CITS: [3304135]|.
/
/Position 34 (the anticodon first letter, or the wobble position) or position 37 (the position next to the anticodon) frequently contains highly modified nucleosides. The wobble modifications at position 34 are important for precise decoding mediated by the codon-anticodon interaction. The so called "hypermodified" nucleosides at position 37 function in translational reading-frame maintenance. These are usually modified purine nucleosides with large molecular weight. Their high hydrophobicity enhances the codon-anticodon interaction, and their modifications prevent the formation of an incorrect Watson�Crick base pair with the codon�s first letter. Some of these hypermodified nucleosides, known as  wye bases, contain a tricyclic structure. The most complex wye base identified thus far is |FRAME: CPD-15385| (yW), which is found only at position 37 of eukaryotic |FRAME: PHE-tRNAs|, and is generated from guanine |CITS: [4586620]| in 5 steps, as described in |FRAME: PWY-7283|. 
/
/While |FRAME: CPD-15385| has been found only in eukaryotic |FRAME: PHE-tRNAs|, two of the intermediates in the pathway leading to its synthesis, namely |FRAME: CPD-15399| (yW-86) and |FRAME: CPD-15401| (yW-72), have also been found as the final products in tRNA of several Archaea that belong to the |FRAME: TAX-28890| phylum |CITS: [20382657]|. 
/
/The first reaction in the pathway leading to their synthesis, the methylation of guanine at position 37 of tRNA, is catalyzed by trm5 gene products. These proteins are not specific for |FRAME: PHE-tRNAs|, as the anticodon sequence is not critical for their tRNA recognition |CITS: [3556165][15248782]| (all subsequent steps in the pathway are specific for |FRAME: PHE-tRNAs|).
/Many archaea contain two and even three homologs of the yeast |FRAME: G3O-31120| gene, which were named |FRAME: G-16040|, |FRAME: G-16041| and <i>trm5c</i>. The two genes from |FRAME: TAX-29292| have been cloned and studied, and were shown to differ by the fact that  |FRAME: G-16040| is bifunctional and can catalyze additional methylations leading to formation of different wye bases (see |FRAME: PWY-7285|) |CITS: [20382657]|.
/
/The second step is catalyzed by homologs of the yeast |FRAME: G3O-34098|, |FRAME: Radical-AdoMet-Enzymes| that contains multiple iron-sulfur centers. Unlike the eukaryotic enzymes, the archaeal enzymes do not have a flavodoxin domain (which usually serves in electron transfer to the iron-sulfur cluster). Thus, it is likely that another enzyme serves as the elctron donor to the |FRAME: G-16042| enzymes |CITS: [17881823]|.

/The latter part of the pathway is responsible for the addition of an &alpha;-amino-&alpha;-carboxypropyl side chain at carbon C-7. It consists of two steps catalyzed by |FRAME: G-16043| and <i>taw3</i> genes. While the |FRAME: G-16043| genes from |FRAME: TAX-53953| and |FRAME: TAX-2190| were cloned and characterized |CITS: [19717466]|, no archaeal <i>taw3</i> genes, which are homologs of the yeast |FRAME: G3O-30560| gene, have been studied to date (June 2013). It has been proposed that the archaeal Taw3 proteins can methylate |FRAME: CPD-15399|, |FRAME: CPD-15386| and |FRAME: CPD-15388| at the N4 position (unlike the yeast enzyme, which can methylate only |FRAME: CPD-15399|) |CITS: [20382657]|. It is not known whether each of the two taw3 genes found in |FRAME: TAX-29292| can catalyze all activities, or perhaps each gene is specific for one or two substrates.

COMMENT - Sulfite and nitrite reductases catalyze the six-electron reduction of sulphite to sulfide and nitrite to
/ ammonia, respectively, which are key enzymatic steps
/in the assimilation of sulfur and nitrogen into all life forms |CITS: [8994874]|. Siroheme, a modified cyclic tetrapyrrole, similar in structure to heme, chlorophyll and cobalamin, is used as a prosthetic group by sulfite and nitrite reductases |CITS: [4583265]|.  Similar to many cyclic tetrapyrroles, siroheme coordinates with a metal in its central cavity. While siroheme and heme coordinate an iron atom, chlorophyll and cobalamin coordinate maganesium and cobalt, respectively.
/
/Assimilatory sulfite reductases are found in bacteria, plants and fungi, but not in animals, while dissimilatory sulfite reductases are found in diverse sulfate-reducing eubacteria and some species of thermophilic archaebacteria |CITS: [8994874]|.  Assimilatory nitrite reductases are also found in bacteria, plants, and fungi |CITS: [8994874]|, but not in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Thus, in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> siroheme is used exclusively in sulfite reductase.
/
/The biologically important modified tetrapyrroles, such as siroheme, heme, chlorophyll and cobalamin share a common biosynthetic pathway up to the synthesis of the first macrocyclic intermediate uroporphyrinogen-III |CITS: [2077690]|.  Siroheme is biosynthesized from uroporphyringoen-III in four enzymatic steps:  two transmethylations, a dehydrogenation, and a ferrochelation |CITS: [10051442]|. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i> the two transmethylations are catalyzed by Met1p, a uroporphyrin III methyltransferase that requires S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as a methyl donor, and the dehydrogenation and ferrochelation reactions are catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme Met8p |CITS: [10051442], [9003798], [11980703]|. In <i>Escherichia coli</i> K12 a single trifunctional enzyme,  siroheme synthase (CysG), catalyzes all four siroheme biosynthetic reactions |CITS: [7945210]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamin diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|, |FRAME: CPLX3O-118 "pyruvate decarboxylase"|, and |FRAME: CPLX66-42 "&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase"| |CITS:[15326535]|. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/Thiamin is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Since the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| is a very complex process, many organisms possess various salvage pathways that enable them to rescue thiamin fragments obtained from the environment. This pathway describes the salvage of base-degraded thiamin compounds, and starts with |FRAME: CPD-13577|, a compound that is generated by base-mediated degradation of the thiazolium moiety of thiamin |CITS: [17618314]|.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-13577 "Formylaminopyrimidine"| is transported into the cell and deformylated by |FRAME: MONOMER-16806| (|FRAME: G-14641|). The resulting |FRAME: CPD-13578| is converted to |FRAME: HMP| (HMP) by |FRAME: BSU11650-MONOMER "4-amino-5-aminomethyl-2-methylpyrimidine hydrolase"| (TenA, thiaminase II). The salvaged HMP is then phosphorylated to form |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP|, which is incorporated into the <i>de novo</i> thiamin biosynthetic pathway |CITS: [18054064]|.
/
/In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> the trifunctional fusion protein THI20p is also able to hydrolyze |FRAME:CPD-13578| to form |FRAME:HMP| in this salvage pathway. The enzyme which exhibits HMP/HMP-P kinase and thiaminase II activity was a puzzle for a long time as it apparently fuses |FRAME:THIAMINE| biosynthetic and degradation activities in one enzyme. However, those activities, encoded by several monomers in bacteria, fit well in the |FRAME:THIAMINE| salvage pathway as they hydrolyze |FRAME:THIAMINE| and similar compounds, e.g. |FRAME:CPD-13578| to |FRAME:HMP| which is immediately phosphorylated by the HMP/HMP-P kinase activity of the same protein |CITS:[15967475] [18028398] [21904031]|.     
/
/The key enzyme in this pathway, |FRAME: BSU11650-MONOMER|, was considered a thiamin degradation enzyme for a long time after its discovery |CITS: [13243520]|, since it is able to catalyze the hydrolysis of thiamine to its thiazole and pyrimidine components. Its true nature as a salvage enzyme was revealed only five decades later |CITS: [17618314]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: PRO| is a non-essential amino acid whose biosynthesis depends on the carbon skeleton of |FRAME: GLT|.
/
/|FRAME: PRO| is synthesized from |FRAME: GLT| in the cytoplasm. The |FRAME: EC-1.5.1.2| (|FRAME: YER023W|) activity in this pathway is identical to the one in |FRAME: ARG-PRO-PWY "arginine degradation"| |CITS:[ 6997271]|. Since these two pathways converge at this step, the requirement for proline in |FRAME: YDR300C| and |FRAME: YOR323C| mutant strains can be satisfied by |FRAME: ARG|. However, these mutant strains cannot grow on rich media because the presence of optimal nitrogen sources causes the repression of genes necessary for arginine degradation |CITS:[2824433]|, |CITS:[10640599]|.
/
/Many of the genes involved in S. cerevisiae amino acid biosynthesis are coregulated by a process known as the general
/amino acid control system. In response to starvation for any single amino acid, the expression of many biosynthetic enzymes is upregulated |CITS:[3045517]|. Mutational studies indicate that both |FRAME: YDR300C| and |FRAME: YOR323C| expression are regulated by general amino acid control, mediated by the transcriptional activator |FRAME: G3O-30137| |CITS:[1350780]|. However, expression profiling by microarray analysis shows that only |FRAME: YOR323C| is activated by |FRAME: G3O-30137| |CITS:[11390663]|. In contrast, the expression of |FRAME: YER023W| appears to be constitutively expressed and under no form of regulation.

COMMENT - The biosynthesis of the vitamin B1 |FRAME:THIAMINE| in fungi and plants involves the formation of two main compounds, i.e. |FRAME:THZ-P| and |FRAME:AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP| originating from independent pathway branches (see |FRAME:PWY-6908|) |CITS:[19348578]|. The biosynthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| and its active derivate |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| which serves as cofactor for a plethora of enzymes being essential in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism has been investigated in great detail in bacteria (see for example |FRAME:PWY-6894|). Less is known about the pathway in fungi, e.g. <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> but considerable progress has been made over the last decade (reviewed in |CITS:[18161008]|).  
/
/
/Besides the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| yeasts are known to employ additional salvage pathways which enables them to re-utilize degradation products of |FRAME:THIAMINE| (see |FRAME:PWY-7356|) and e.g. |FRAME:THZ-P| either from endogenous processes or through uptake from the environment |CITS:[18161008]|. The salvage of |FRAME:THZ| (this pathway) (see also the bacterial |FRAME:PWY-6897|) is possible through the enzymatic action of the bifunctional  TMP diphosphorylase/hydroxyethylthiazole kinase (THI6) |CITS:[8394314]|. Utilizing mutants deficient in either the hydroxyethylthiazole kinase or the TMP diphosphorylase activity it could be shown that yeast with a defect in the hydroxyethylthiazole kinase activity was still able to grow on |FRAME:THIAMINE| free medium. That indicates that |FRAME:THZ| is not an essential intermediate for the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE|. Instead, the hydroxyethylthiazole kinase activity is rather involved in the salvage of |FRAME:THZ| which may occur within or outside the yeast cell as a degradation product from |FRAME:THIAMINE| or other intermediates |CITS:[7982968]|.

COMMENT - Thiaminase II activity has been observed in bacteria |CITS:[15709744]| and fungi, more specifically in cell free extracts of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> |CITS:[3305065]| but its physiological role remained unresolved for a long time. In bacteria a thiamin salvage pathway has been reported in which the key enzyme thiaminase II (TenA) catalyzed the hydrolysis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| and thiamine analogs to form |FRAME:HMP|. The latter represents a precursor for the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| and its phosphorylated derivatives (see |FRAME:PWY-6899|)  |CITS:[17618314] [17637774]|.
/
/<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> employs an enzyme, i.e. THI20p which is characterized by unique properties, namely the display of both |FRAME:THIAMINE| biosynthetic and degradation activities in one fusion protein. THI20 encodes a trifunctional protein which exhibits HMP kinase (EC 2.7.1.49) and HMP-P kinase (EC 2.7.4.7) from a dimeric structure of the N-terminal domain and thiaminase II activity (EC 3.5.99.2) from a dimeric structure of the C-terminal domain linked together through a loop and a short helix |CITS:[15967475] [21904031]|. Utilizing various mutant strains of yeast devoid of one or more activities of the trifunctional enzyme it could be shown that the thiaminase II activity was not required for the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| but was rather involved in the salvage of |FRAME:THIAMINE| |CITS:[18028398]|.  The |FRAME:THIAMINE| degrading capacity of thiaminase II had been demonstrated in yeast |CITS:[15967475]| (this pathway) but THI20p was also able to hydrolyze |FRAME:THIAMINE| analogs such as |FRAME:CPD-13578| (see |FRAME:PWY-6899|) or |FRAME:CPD-15776| and |FRAME:CPD-15777| (see |FRAME:PWY-7357| |CITS:[18028398]|.  
/
/It is known that yeast can take up both |FRAME:HMP| and |FRAME:THZ| from its environment |CITS:[4591128] [3027234] [2407290]| indicating that the trifunctional HMP/HMP-P kinase and thiaminase II can handle bot endogenous and exogenous degradation products of |FRAME:THIAMINE|.  Thiaminase II had been demonstrated to significantly increase activity after the addition of |FRAME:ATP|. This finding and the observation that  |FRAME:HMP|, the direct product of the thiaminase II catalysis, is a strong inhibitor of that reaction implies the immediate phosphorylation by the HMP/HMP-P kinase activities of the same enzyme and strongly indicates that the physiological role of THI20 lies in the salvage pathway(s) of |FRAME:THIAMINE|  |CITS:[18028398]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME:THIAMINE Thiamin| (vitamin B1) and its biological active derivate |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| is synthesized in prokaryotes, yeasts and plants utilizing complex pathways |CITS:[Rapala-Kozik11] [18161008]|. Besides the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| and derivatives many salvage pathways have been evolved to recycle thiamin degradation products from the endogenous and exogenous environment |CITS:[19348578] [16826377] [4591128] [3027234] [2407290]|.
/
/Thiaminase II activity has been observed in bacteria |CITS:[15709744]| and fungi, more specifically in cell free extracts of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> |CITS:[3305065]| but its physiological role remained unresolved for a long time. In bacteria a thiamin salvage pathway has been reported in which the key enzyme thiaminase II (TenA) catalyzed the hydrolysis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| and thiamine analogs to form |FRAME:HMP|. The latter represents a precursor for the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| and its phosphorylated derivatives (see |FRAME:PWY-6899|)  |CITS:[17618314] [17637774]|.
/
/<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> employs an enzyme, i.e. THI20p which is characterized by unique properties, i.e. the display of both |FRAME:THIAMINE| biosynthetic and degradation activities in one fusion protein. THI20 encodes a trifunctional protein which exhibits HMP kinase (EC 2.7.1.49) and HMP-P kinase (EC 2.7.4.7) from a dimeric structure of the N-terminal domain and thiaminase II activity (EC 3.5.99.2) from a dimeric structure of the C-terminal domain linked together through a loop and a short helix |CITS:[15967475] [21904031]|. The |FRAME:THIAMINE| degrading property of thiaminase II had been demonstrated in yeast |CITS:[15967475]| (see |FRAME:PWY-7356|) but THI20p was also able to hydrolyze |FRAME:THIAMINE| analogs such as |FRAME:CPD-13578| (see |FRAME:PWY-6899|) or |FRAME:CPD-15776| and |FRAME:CPD-15777| (this pathway) |CITS:[18028398]|.  
/
/The pathway depicted above illustrates the ability of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> to hydrolyze synthetic antagonists of |FRAME:THIAMINE| which are known to inhibit the growth of yeast by each of the thiamine analogs alone |CITS:[6373358]|. However, when both synthetic thiamins are applied together the production of the potential <i>de novo</i> |FRAME:THIAMINE| precursor |FRAME:HMP| and |FRAME:THZ| increases significantly indicating a hydrolysis of the |FRAME:THIAMINE| analogs. This was not the case when yeast mutants deficient in THI20 (&Delta;thi20) were assayed with |FRAME:CPD-15776| and |FRAME:CPD-15777|  |CITS:[18028398]| emphasizing the participation of the thiaminase II in the process as previously reported |CITS:[3305065]|.
