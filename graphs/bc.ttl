    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: Peroxiredoxins Peroxiredoxins| are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes that have been identified in eubacteria, archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|. All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine (the peroxidative cysteine or Cp) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity. Substrates for peroxiredoxins include |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE "hydrogen peroxides"|, |FRAME: Alkyl-Hydro-Peroxides "alkyl hydroperoxides"|, and |FRAME: CPD0-1395 peroxynitrites|.


Depending on the specific peroxiredoxin enzyme, reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE|, |FRAME: Thioredoxin thioredoxin|, |FRAME: Glutaredoxins glutaredoxin|, cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.



The first peroxiredoxin was identified in |FRAME: TAX-4932| in 1987 and named thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA), because it was thought to remove reactive sulfur species rather than reactive oxygen species |CITS: [2895105]|. The correct functional assignment was made after the discovery of AhpC (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase) in |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [2191951]|.



All peroxiredoxins contain an L-cysteine residue that attacks the substrate (Cp) and becomes hydroxylated during the catalytic cycle. Multiple classification systems have been suggested for the peroxiredoxins, based on the mechanism for the reduction of the hydroxylated Cp residue and on sequence analysis.



According to an earlier classification system, the enzymes were categorized into three classes based on the location or absence of a second L-cysteine residue (CR) that is involved in restoring Cp to its reduced state. The three classes are:



1. |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins "2-Cys-peroxiredoxins"| (also called typical 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins) are homodimeric and contain two conserved (Cp and CR) cysteine residues per subunit. The Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the CR of the other subunit to form an intersubunit disulfide.



2. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins "Type II peroxiredoxins"|, (also called atypical 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins), are monomeric, and the Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the CR of the same subunit, forming an intrasubunit disulfide. Members of this class can use thioredoxin and/or glutaredoxin as the reductant |CITS: [12913160]|. A subtype is the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins "Q-type peroxiredoxins"|, which are homologs of the |FRAME: EG10108| (bacterioferritin co-migrating protein) of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [10998352]|.



3. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins "1-Cys-peroxiredoxins"| contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine |CITS: [8914536]|. Given the absence of a CR, Cp&ndash;SOH of 1-Cys enzymes cannot be resolved within the peroxiredoxin molecules and instead forms a disulfide with a cysteine residue provided by other proteins or small thiol molecules |CITS: [20919932]|.



In later publications the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins "Q-type peroxiredoxins"| are considered a separate 4th class |CITS: [15890615][18493039]|.



According to the second classification system, which was introduced in 2011 based on sequence analysis of more than 3500 enzymes, the enzymes are divided into six classes -  AhpC-Prx1 (identical to the typical 2-Cys class), BCP-PrxQ (named after the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: EG10108| and plant |FRAME: AT3G26060|), Tpx (named for the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: G6660|), Prx5 (named for the mammalian |FRAME: HS05016-MONOMER|), Prx6 (named for the mammalian |FRAME: CPLX-9416|, sometimes referred to as the 1-Cys group), and AhpE (named for |FRAME: TAX-1773| AhpE) |CITS: [21287625]|.



Mammalian cells express six peroxiredoxins - PrxI to PrxIV are 2-Cys, PrxV is an atypical 2-Cys, and PrxVI is 1-Cys |CITS: [11795591]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| expresses five peroxiredoxins -  Tsa1 and Tsa2 are two 2-Cys, Ahp1 and nTpx are atypical 2-Cys, and mTpx is 1-Cys |CITS: [26813659]|. The plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| expresses nine peroxiredoxins.

About phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P):



PI5P represents only 0.5% of the PI pool present in most cells. However, its levels strongly fluctuate due to external stimuli such as TCR activation, insulin treatment, oxidative stress, and pathogen cellular invasion |CITS: [28302928]|.



Several studies found changes in intracellular PI5P levels during cell cycle progression, as well as upon thrombin treatment and osmotic stress |CITS: [10854858][11463365][11716778]|. The plant homeodomain-containing ING2 protein, a candidate tumor suppressor, was shown to act as a nuclear PI5P receptor, a function that regulates its ability to activate p53 |CITS: [12859901]|. PI5P has also been tied to tumor suppression via its potential regulation of Akt. It was demonstrated that the loss of PI5P, via a conversion to |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA|, resulted in a decrease in Akt activity |CITS: [12897244]|. In addition, PI5P was shown to enhance the activity of various myotubularin phosphatases (MTM1, MTMR3, and MTMR6) toward their preferred substrate |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-35-BISPH|, presumably through allosteric regulation |CITS: [12646134]|). Together these studies stress the importance of PI5P as a bona fide signaling molecule |CITS: [15247229]|.

bc:2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins rdfs:label "a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin" ;
    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: Peroxiredoxins Peroxiredoxins| are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes that have been identified in eubacteria, archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|. All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine (the peroxidative cysteine or Cp) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity. Substrates for peroxiredoxins include |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE "hydrogen peroxides"|, |FRAME: Alkyl-Hydro-Peroxides "alkyl hydroperoxides"|, and |FRAME: CPD0-1395 peroxynitrites|.


Depending on the specific peroxiredoxin enzyme, reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE|, |FRAME: Thioredoxin thioredoxin|, |FRAME: Glutaredoxins glutaredoxin|, cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.



The first peroxiredoxin was identified in |FRAME: TAX-4932| in 1987 and named thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA), because it was thought to remove reactive sulfur species rather than reactive oxygen species |CITS: [2895105]|. The correct functional assignment was made after the discovery of AhpC (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase) in |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [2191951]|.



All peroxiredoxins contain an L-cysteine residue that attacks the substrate (Cp) and becomes hydroxylated during the catalytic cycle. Multiple classification systems have been suggested for the peroxiredoxins, based on the mechanism for the reduction of the hydroxylated Cp residue and on sequence analysis.



According to an earlier classification system, the enzymes were categorized into three classes based on the location or absence of a second L-cysteine residue (CR) that is involved in restoring Cp to its reduced state. The three classes are:



1. |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins "2-Cys-peroxiredoxins"| (also called typical 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins) are homodimeric and contain two conserved (Cp and CR) cysteine residues per subunit. The Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the CR of the other subunit to form an intersubunit disulfide.



2. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins "Type II peroxiredoxins"|, (also called atypical 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins), are monomeric, and the Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the CR of the same subunit, forming an intrasubunit disulfide. Members of this class can use thioredoxin and/or glutaredoxin as the reductant |CITS: [12913160]|. A subtype is the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins "Q-type peroxiredoxins"|, which are homologs of the |FRAME: EG10108| (bacterioferritin co-migrating protein) of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [10998352]|.



3. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins "1-Cys-peroxiredoxins"| contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine |CITS: [8914536]|. Given the absence of a CR, Cp&ndash;SOH of 1-Cys enzymes cannot be resolved within the peroxiredoxin molecules and instead forms a disulfide with a cysteine residue provided by other proteins or small thiol molecules |CITS: [20919932]|.



In later publications the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins "Q-type peroxiredoxins"| are considered a separate 4th class |CITS: [15890615][18493039]|.



According to the second classification system, which was introduced in 2011 based on sequence analysis of more than 3500 enzymes, the enzymes are divided into six classes -  AhpC-Prx1 (identical to the typical 2-Cys class), BCP-PrxQ (named after the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: EG10108| and plant |FRAME: AT3G26060|), Tpx (named for the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: G6660|), Prx5 (named for the mammalian |FRAME: HS05016-MONOMER|), Prx6 (named for the mammalian |FRAME: CPLX-9416|, sometimes referred to as the 1-Cys group), and AhpE (named for |FRAME: TAX-1773| AhpE) |CITS: [21287625]|.



Mammalian cells express six peroxiredoxins - PrxI to PrxIV are 2-Cys, PrxV is an atypical 2-Cys, and PrxVI is 1-Cys |CITS: [11795591]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| expresses five peroxiredoxins -  Tsa1 and Tsa2 are two 2-Cys, Ahp1 and nTpx are atypical 2-Cys, and mTpx is 1-Cys |CITS: [26813659]|. The plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| expresses nine peroxiredoxins.



The class of typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins is both the largest and the most widely distributed, with members found in archaea, bacteria, and all classes of eukaryotes. Members of this subfamily include the bacterial AhpC proteins, tryparedoxin peroxidases, plant Prxs including Arabidopsis thaliana 2-Cys Prxs and barley Bas1, the yeast TSA1 and TSA2 proteins, and human PrxI, II, III, and IV.



Members of the AhpC-Prx1 subfamily have been linked with important roles in cellular signaling and some appear to be regulated by phosphorylation |CITS: [15890005][20178744]|.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: EC-4.2.1.167|, which participates in the fermentation pathways of |FRAME: GLT|, |FRAME: GLN| and |FRAME: HIS| in some anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [15374661]|, is a member of the (R)-2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase family.


Members of this family are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive activator (component A) and a dehydratase (component D). Component A is a homodimer with one [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster bound in the dimer interface, while component D is a heterodimer with 1-2 [4Fe&ndash;4S] clusters and FMN. In order to catalyze the reaction, the dehydratase requires one high-energy electron that transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion, facilitating the elimination of the hydroxyl group. The electron needs to be supplied only once, before the first reaction takes place, since it is regenerated at the end of each reaction cycle. This initial activation is provided by the activator. 



The activator, which has been named |FRAME: CPLX-9331 archerase| because its open position resembles an archer shooting arrows, binds two ADP molecules. Upon the reduction of its [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster by a single electron, delivered by a dedicated flavodoxin, the two ADP molecules exchange for two ATP molecules, resulting in a large conformational change. The change results in the activator binding to the dehydratase component, upon which the two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed and the electron is transferred to the dehydratase, activating it |CITS: [15374661][18337824]|.



The structure shown here depicts the reduced [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: FeS-Proteins "Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins"| contain iron atom(s) ligated by inorganic sulfide and/or at least two cysteinyl (Cys) ligands. The main function of the Fe-S active sites is electron transfer, mostly in the range of low oxidation-reduction potentials.
In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur proteins are also known to participate in the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|. Fe-S active sites are perhaps the most ancient cofactors.



The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)4]2-, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.



Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.



As mentioned above, small electron transfer proteins that contain only mononuclear [Fe(Cys)4]2- complexes are called |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 



Many complex Fe-S proteins contain multiple clusters arranged in chains, separated 1 - 1.4 nm apart, which allow electron transfer across considerable distances. Other electron-transferring groups such as heme or flavin may also be present. Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-7.1.1.2 "complex I"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 "complex II"| and |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.8 "complex III"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 "photosystem I"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 "xanthine dehydrogenase"|.



Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 "4Fe-4S clusters"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.



It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.

S5 influences translational fidelity.  Certain mutations in rpsE confer a "ribosomal ambiguity" (ram) phenotype, which is characterized by decreased growth rate, increased streptomycin sensitivity, and increased errors in translation |CITS: [4589342][4589343][1105158]|.

They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential, and do not carry out classical enzyme functions.



Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. 



In [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins the Fe ions are ligated by four |FRAME: CYS| residues that occur in a -C-X2-C-X2-C-Xn- pattern.

Omission of one of the Cys residues from the conserved motif (usually the third) gives rise to the |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "3Fe-4S ferredoxins"|.



Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.


There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with an L-aspartyl group bound to the terminal 2'-OH group, as is the case in |FRAME: TAX-562|. The enzymes from yeast and cow are able to attach the acyl group at either the 2'- or the 3'-OH groups |CITS: [17206069]|.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of several cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.


During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H2PteGlu1. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H4PteGlu1, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.



Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.



The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.



The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.


There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

    rdfs:comment """Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which
electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor.

However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the

acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that

function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps

that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the

acceptor.



Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be

|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other

type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding

member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal

acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of

|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in

|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.



Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic

compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),

or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|,

|FRAME: NITROUS-OXIDE|, |FRAME: CHLORATE|, |FRAME: CPD0-1385|,

|FRAME: MN+3 "oxidized manganese ions"|, |FRAME: FE+3 "ferric iron"|, gold,

|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and

|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).



During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the

membrane due to three potential processes



1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active

pumping of protons across a membrane.



2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.



3. Scalar reactions that consume protons on one side of a membrane, or produce them

on the other side of the membrane, without actually moving a proton from one

compartment to another.



Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit

|FRAME: EC-7.1.2.2 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.



This class, which stands for aerobic respiration, contains pathways through

which electrons flow from various organic and inorganic electron donors to

oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: ALGINATE Alginate| is a major component of the cell walls of |FRAME: TAX-2870| (brown algae), and can make up to 45% of the total algal material. It is a linear polysaccharide of (1-4)-linked |FRAME: CPD-15205|, with variable amounts of its C-5 epimer |FRAME: CPD-15204| |CITS: [Schmidt26]|. The |FRAME: CPD-15205| (M) and |FRAME: CPD-15204| (G) residues are arranged in homopolymeric regions of M and G blocks, interspaced with regions of alternating structure (MG blocks). The physicochemical properties of alginate depend on both the overall M to G ratio and the relative proportions of the three block types in the chain. G block-rich alginate forms a high-strength gel in presence of divalent cations such as calcium, and is found in more rigid parts of the alga. Alginates rich in M or MG blocks are more flexible. The composition varies among species, and within an organism according to the nature and the age of the tissues as well as to the season and to the growing area. Depending on its composition, alginate can absorb 200�300 times its own weight in water, forming a viscous gum.


Historically, alginate extracted from seaweed has had a wide variety of uses. Its unique physical properties enable it to be used as a stabilizer, viscosifier, and gelling agent in the food and beverage, paper and printing, biomaterials,

and pharmaceutical industries |CITS:[9283015][9393029][11018131][12149954][16183570][20581859][25300542]|. Commercial varieties of alginate are extracted from several species, including the giant kelp |FRAME: TAX-35122|, |FRAME: TAX-52969|, and various types of |FRAME: TAX-33637|.



The alginates formed by brown algae are non-acetylated. An acetylated form of alginate is produced by bacteria that belong to the |FRAME: TAX-286| and |FRAME: TAX-352| genera. The higher the degree of O-acetylation, the higher the viscosity and pseudoplastic rheology of the alginate |CITS: [Skjak-Braek88]|. The biological function of alginates differs between the two genera. In |FRAME: TAX-286| alginate is associated with biofilms, promoting bacterial adherence to target cell walls |CITS: [3155514]|. Alginate production is a major contributing factor in chronic pulmonary infections by |FRAME: TAX-287|, the causative agent of cystic fibrosis |CITS: [3155514]|. Most strains of |FRAME: TAX-287| do not produce alginate, although alginate is always produced in the lung of CF pateints. it is believed that alginate encapsulation protects the infecting bacterial cells from phagocytosis, as well as from antibiotic therapy. 



In |FRAME: TAX-352| alginate is a structural element in the wall of the cyst, a desiccation-resistant capsule that is formed under adverse environmental conditions |CITS: [16912921]|.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

    rdfs:comment """In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".



Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".



While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.



Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).

In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.



In many cases, purified enzymes can act in vitro using an artificial electron carrier, and their in vivo electron carrier is not known. This class of "unknown electron carriers" is used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.

The spontaneous breakdown of the dioxetanone releases the energy (about 60 kcal/mole) that is necessary to generate an |FRAME: CPD-20235 "excited state of coelentramide|. In vitro this decarboxylation is accompanied by the emission of blue light, while in vivo the energy is transferred to excite |FRAME: GFP "a green fluorescent protein"| by <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%B6rster_resonance_energy_transfer">F&ouml;rster resonance energy transfer</A> (FRET) |CITS: [4151620]|.


During the luminescence reaction aequorin is converted into a |FRAME: Excited-blue-fluorescent-proteins "blue fluorescent protein"| (BFP), a dissociable complex of Ca2+-bound apoaequorin and coelenteramide.

The enzyme was first purified in 1962 from the jellyfish |FRAME: TAX-2747904|. The purification involved the painstaking collection and processing of more than 10,000 jellyfish, and resulted in 5 mg of purified protein |CITS: [Shimomura62][13911999][7654844]|. Cloning and expression of the complementary DNA for aequorin were first reported in 1985 |CITS: [3858813][2579647]|. Sequence analysis showed the presence of three E-F hand structures that are characteristic for Ca2+-binding sites, and an overall structure similar to that of calmoduline.



Crystals of the recombinant protein were prepared in 1993, but their quality was not sufficient for X-ray analysis |CITS: [8451237]|. Higher quality crystals were generated later and used for obtaining the full crystal structure  at 2.3 &Aring; resolution. The protein scaffold consists of four EF-hand domains arranged in pairs to form the globular molecule, with each pair of 'hands' arranged back-to-back, forming short stretches of beta-sheet, as seen in other EF-hand proteins. The crystal structure also confirmed that coelenterazine and oxygen are bound in the form of coelenterazine-2-hydroperoxide |CITS: [10830969]|. A crystal structure of calcium-loaded apo-aequorin has shown that all three Ca2+-binding loops bind calcium ions |CITS: [15689515]|.

During the reaction, a change in the conformation of aequorin takes place, leading to cyclization of the peroxide into a dioxetanone structure, which collapses, releasing a CO2 molecule.

Sequence analysis showed the presence of three E-F hand structures that are characteristic for Ca2+-binding sites, and an overall structure similar to that of calmoduline.

The second clade consists of thioredoxin-dependent enzymes (|FRAME: EC-1.20.4.4|), and is found in Gram-positive bacteria, as well as many Gram-negative proteobacteria (see |FRAME: TAX-1280| |FRAME: MONOMER-10862|) |CITS: [15691908]|.

A fourth clade consists of mycothiol-dependent system (|FRAME: EC-2.8.4.2| and |FRAME: EC-1.20.4.3|). That system was described from the Gram-positive bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1718|.

The understanding of the enzyme's function has evolved siginificantly over the years. According to the current (2019) model, derived from the human enzyme, the true substrate is |FRAME: CPD-22658| |CITS: [15526190]|. |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE Glutathione|, the major thiol in mammalian cells, is present at millimolar concentrations and reacts readily with arsenite to form the triglutathione complex inside cells.



The methyltransferase binds As(III) in a series of three thiol transfer reactions from |FRAME: CPD-22658|, resulting in As(III) that is 3-coordinately bound to three conserved cysteine residues |CITS: [29894638]|. Once bound to the enzyme, the following steps take place |CITS: [25325836][25760600]|:



(1) The methyl group of SAM is attacked by the arsenic lone pair;



(2) A pentavalent |FRAME: METHYLARSONATE| intermediate is formed and reduced to an enzyme-bound |FRAME: METHYLARSONITE| intermediate by Cys32, with formation of a Cys32&ndash;Cys61 disulfide;



(3) The disulfide is reduced with electrons from thioredoxin;



At this point the substrate can dissociate from the enzyme, forming a cytosolic pool of |FRAME: METHYLARSONITE|. However, this dissociation is slow since |FRAME: METHYLARSONITE| has high affinity for two cysteine residues of the binding site, and thus in most cases the enzyme proceeds to the next step: 



(4) The enzyme undergoes the next round of methylation, forming a pentavalent |FRAME: DIMETHYLARSINATE| intermediate;



(5) The intermediate is reduced to |FRAME: DIMETHYLARSINOUS-ACID| by Cys61, resulting in a Cys61&ndash;Cys156 disulfide;



(6) The disulfide bond is reduced by a second thioredoxin molecule, regenerating the enzyme and releasing |FRAME: DIMETHYLARSINOUS-ACID|.



In some cases the enzyme can catalyze three rounds of methylation instead of two, generating  the volatile compound |FRAME: CPD-22659| |CITS: [27730229]|.

Eight different avermectins are produced, consisting of four pairs of homologue compounds, with a major (a-component) and minor (b-component) components that are produced in ratios of 80:20 to 90:10. The a compounds and b compounds differ by having a butyl or a propyl side chain, respectively. Other differences regard the presence or absence of a double bond in one of the ketide rings and a methyl group in one of the |FRAME: CPD-13948| sugars |CITS: [19168364]|.



The avermectins block the transmission of electrical activity in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells mostly by enhancing the effects of glutamate at the glutamate-gated chloride channel that is specific to protostome invertebrates. This results in an influx of chloride ions into the cells, leading to hyperpolarisation and subsequent paralysis of invertebrate neuromuscular systems |CITS: [23038250]|.



Half of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to William C. Campbell and Satoshi Omura for discovering avermectin.



Several derivatives of avermectins have been developed, including |FRAME: CPD-25537|, |FRAME: CPD-25538|, |FRAME: CPD-22128|, |FRAME: CPD-25539|, and |FRAME: CPD-25437|.

Green sulfur bacteria can grow at light intensities that are too low to support growth of any other phototroph, up to a million times lower light than normal sunlight |CITS: [Overmann92]|.


Chlorosomes contain about 1,500 bacteriochlorophyll molecules per reaction center. They are filled with 10�30 rod-shaped elements which are oriented parallel to the long axis of the chlorosomes and have a diameter of 10 nm. Each rod consists of a tubular bilayer formed by self-organization of the antenna bacteriochlorophyll molecules. Unlike all other known photosynthetic antenna, in which the chlorophyll molecules are bound to proteins, chlorosomes do not contain accessory proteins. The chlorosomal bacteriochlorophyll pigments are able to self-aggregate due to their unique chemical characteristics.



The bacteriochlorophylls found in chlorosomes are either |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll c"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll d"| or |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll e"|, depending on the species. They all possess a hydroxyl group at the C31 position that allows them to chelate the Mg atom of a neighboring molecule and to interact with the C13-oxo carbonyl group of another neighboring pigment molecule, affording the self-aggregation |CITS: [16121276][19435848][22210764]|. In addition, all of these bacteriochlorophylls lack C-132-methylcarboxyl side chains, which are found in all other (bacterio)chlorophylls but would interfere with the ability to form aggregates |CITS: [16245042]|.



Despite of their names, |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll c"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll d"| and |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll e"| are actually chlorins rather than bacteriochlorins. All three are usually found with an unsaturated farnesyl tail rather than phytyl tails |CITS: [2350541][Borrego99]|, although exceptions have been reported.



In chlorosomes of |FRAME:  TAX-191412| (but not |FRAME: TAX-1106| |CITS: [Risch79][3442679]|) all three types of bacteriochlorophyll appear in several forms with different degrees of methylation at the C-82 and C-121 carbons |CITS: [12656478][14610639]|. The variety in methylation is depicted in the structure shown here by the R groups. In general, pimgents produced by cultures grown at lower light intensities are more highly methylated at the C-82 position than pigments produced by cells of the same organism grown at higher light intensities. Different methylation states result in different aggregation properties and light absorbance of the chlorosome, and thus methylation is used as an adaptation to altering envireonmental conditions. 



Most of the green sulfur bacteria growing in stratified lakes contain |FRAME:CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll d"|, and species containing |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll c"| are rarely found |CITS: [vanGemerden95]|.

The butirosins are unique among naturally occurring aminoglycosides since they contain an (S)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) side-chain at the C-1 amine of the central 2-deoxystreptamine ring.

It is a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to over ten thousand &beta;(1&rarr;4) linked D-glucose units, and is the structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes.


Cellulose is a straight chain polymer. Unlike |FRAME: Starch starch| or |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|, there is no coiling or branching, and the molecule adopts an extended and stiff rod-like conformation. The multiple hydroxyl groups on the glucose moieties from one chain form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms on neighbor chains, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming microfibrils with high tensile strength. 



Several different crystalline structures of cellulose are known, corresponding to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Known crystalline forms are named cellulose I, cellulose II, cellulose III and cellulose IV.  Cellulose I is further divided into I&alpha; and I&beta;, with the former formed by bacteria and algae and the latter by higher plants. 

Crystalline cellulose is not soluble. It is converted to a soluble, amorphus structure only at a temperature of 320 &deg;C.



Molecules with very small chain length, known as |FRAME: Cellodextrins cellodextrins|, are typically soluble in water and organic solvents.

Ganglioside are components of the cell plasma membrane that modulates cell signal transduction events, and appear to concentrate in lipid rafts.


The name ganglioside is derived from ganglion cells of the brain, from which the first gangliosides were isolated by the German scientist Ernst Klenk in 1942.

The glycan moiety of these glycoproteins constitutes 90% to 98% of the weight. It usually consists of branched type II arabino-3,6-galactans, primarily O-linked to Hyp residues |CITS: [20388666]|.



In general, the glycan moieties of plant arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) demonstrate a great structural and compositional variability. The structure shown here is based on a representative Hyp-AG polysaccharide (AHP-1) released by base hydrolysis from a synthetic AGP (Ala-Hyp)51 from tobacco BY2 cells |CITS: [14724279]|.

    rdfs:comment """Rhamnogalacturonan type II (RG-II) is a relatively small polysaccharide that makes up about 10% of |FRAME: Pectin pectin|. Despite its small size, it, is the most structurally complex pectin component. Its &alpha;-1,4-linked D-galacturonate backbone is decorated with four side branches (named A�D) consisting of 12 different types of sugars in over 20 different linkages |CITS: [18486536]|. Some of the sugars are quite rare, including |FRAME: CPD-13046|, |FRAME: CPD-20946| (3-C-carboxy-5-deoxy-L-xylose), and |FRAME: CPD-20949| (Dha). RG-II exists in the primary wall as a dimer that is cross linked by a 1:2 borate-diol diester |CITS: [12226238]|. The borate diester cross link is formed between the apiosyl residue in side chain A of each monomer subunit |CITS: [8798473][10224062]|.


Despite this complexity the structure of RG-II is largely conserved across plant species. It has been reported that the structure is virtually the same in members of the Brassicacea, Cucurbitaceae, Leguminoseae, Apiaceae, Liliaceae, Araceae, Amaryllidaceae, Gramineae, and more families |CITS: [12765781]|. However, later work reported some variation in the side chains and methylation status within and across different plant speces |CITS: [23802881]|.



Please note that the structure shown here is not entirely accurate, due to the inability of software to depict unusual monosaccharides. |FRAME: CPD-13046|, |FRAME: CPD-20946| and |FRAME: CPD-20949| are depicted as generic pentose, hexuronate, and heptose, respectively.

Chlorophyll functions as the main light harvesting pigment in photosynthesis, capturing photons and transfering them to the reaction centers. Chlorophyll absorbs mostly in the blue and, to a lesser extent, red portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, hence its intense green color. There are several variants of chlorophyll (|FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A|, |FRAME: CPD-10334|, |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-B|, |FRAME: CPD-18895|, |FRAME: CPD-10336|, |FRAME: CPD-10337|, |FRAME: CPD-10335|, |FRAME: CPD-18896|, |FRAME: CPD-18897| and |FRAME: CPD-18898|).



While the chlorophyl a found in most organisms is esterified with a |FRAME: PHYTOL| side-chain, some organisms, such as the green sulfur bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1097|, produce a chlorophyll a that is esterified with a |FRAME: CPD-18893| side-chain.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME:CPD-19766 "Factor 430"| (often referred to as coenzyme F430) is a nickel containing tetrapyrrole cofactor that is present in all methanogenic bacteria. It was initially observed in 1977 by Jean LeGall in extracts of |FRAME: TAX-145262|. The name factor 430 (F430) was coined by Gunsalus and Wolfe who reported the absorbance maximumat 430 nm |CITS: [Gunsalus78]|. The compound belongs to the corphins, a class of compounds that combine structural elements of both |FRAME: Corrins corrins| and |FRAME: Porphyrins porphyrins| |CITS: [Eschenmoser86]|.


In 1982 Ellefson et al showed that |FRAME:CPD-19766| is a cofactor of the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.8.4.1| (methyl-coenzyme M reductase) |CITS: [6954513]|. This enzyme catalyzes the final step of methane production in all methanogenic bacteria: the reduction of the methyl group in |FRAME: Me-CoM| to |FRAME:CH4|.



F430 exists in two distinct intracellular pools: either bound to EC 2.8.4.1 or free of protein in the cytosol. Early literature on F430 was confusing due to reports of heterogeneity in F430 samples that depended on the isolation and purification procedures used in different laboratories. Later work showed that F430 exists primarily in two isomeric forms. These forms differ in the relative stereochemical disposition of acid side chains at positions 12 and 13 |CITS: [3356701]|.



The biosynthetic route leading to |FRAME: PWY-5196| was discovered only in 2016 |CITS: [27846569]|.

It is also found in many nonluminous organisms |CITS: [9336010]|.


In bioluminescent systems, |FRAME: OPLOPHORUS-LUCIFERIN coelenterazine| is bound by either |FRAME: Coelenterazine-binding-proteins| or by an aequorin protein, depending on the species. In the first system, upon binding of Ca2+ ions the coelenterazine-binding protein releases coelenterazine, which is then oxidized and decarboxylated by the luciferase enzyme, resulting in |FRAME: CPD-20235|. In the second system, aequorin binds and oxidizes coelenterazine, retainning it in the form of bound |FRAME: CPD-20222|. Upon binding of Ca2+ ions, the enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation and formation of |FRAME: CPD-20235|. In vitro the excited coelenteramide relaxes to the ground state by emission of blue light.

and the storage of iron and sulfur.

In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: CPD-25639 "Mannosylerythritol lipids"| (MELs) are amphiphilic glycolipids that display high surface activity and act as biodetergents (biosurfactants). The compounds are produced by yeast strains that belong to the |FRAME: TAX-5269| and |FRAME: TAX-63261| genera. They show excellent surface-active properties and versatile biochemical actions. The compounds were first described in 1956 from an |FRAME: TAX-5269| species |CITS: [13276861]|. However, the most common MEL producing species are members of the |FRAME: TAX-63261| genus, such as |FRAME: TAX-84753|, |FRAME: TAX-84754|, |FRAME: TAX-84752|, and |FRAME: TAX-203536| |CITS: [25723622]|.


The lipids are acylated at positions O-2' and O-3' by a range of fatty acyl residues. In |FRAME: TAX-5270| the fatty acid at O-2' ranges from C2 to C6, while that at O-3' ranges from C12 to C16. In addition, MELs differ in their acetylation status. Four general types are produced differing in the acetylation of positions O-4' and O-6'. Mel-D has no acetylation, MEL-B is acetylated only at the O-6' position, MEL-C is acetylated only at the O-4' position, and MEL-A is acetylated at both positions |CITS: [Kitamoto90a][Kitamoto90][10570818][17898510]|. 



The biological function of MELs is still unknown, but they are of growing biotechnological interest as a sustainable alternative for chemical surfactants |CITS: [18585066][22901730]|.

Tunicamycins cannot be used clinically since they are also acive against the eukaryotic enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.15|, which is involved in an early step of protein N-glycosylation. The compounds bind specifically to the active site of the enzymes, blocking their activity and terminating the biosynthesis of the polymers at the first commited step |CITS: [ 444447]|.


The first tunicamycin compound was originally isolated in 1957 under the name mycospocidin |CITS: [13513523]| (it was eventually shown to be a tunicamycin |CITS: [Tkacz78]|). A few years later more tunicamycin compounds were isolated from cultures of |FRAME: TAX-1079983|, this time under the name tunicamycin, and initially described as anti-viral agents, although they were subsequently shown to be also active against yeasts, fungi and Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5572750]|. Tunicamycins were subsequently isolated from |FRAME: TAX-1901| |CITS: [468729]| and |FRAME: TAX-1969|, in which they accumulate to much higher concentrations. The process for tunicamycin preparation was patented 1980 with |FRAME: TAX-1079985| |CITS: [Hamill80]|.



All tunicamycins contain |FRAME: URACIL|, |FRAME: N-acetyl-D-glucosamine|, a unique 11-carbon 2-aminodialdose called |FRAME: CPD-19359|, and a fatty acid linked to the amino group of the tunicamine.

It appears to be involved in regulating neural stem cells via the Notch signaling pathway |CITS: [22645129]|.


The |FRAME: CPD-8594 "Lewis X epitope"| is formed by &alpha;(1,3) fucosylation of the N-acetylglucosaminyl residue of |FRAME: B-Gal-14-NacGlc-R|, the disaccharide precursor that can also lead to formation of the |FRAME: Type-2-H-Antigen| by &alpha;(1,2) fucosylation at its terminal galactosyl residue.

In mice the &alpha;-(1,3)-fucosyltransferase encoded by the |FRAME: HS10520| gene is the main contributor to the production of the |FRAME: CPD-8594 "Lewis x"| epitope |CITS: [16973732]|.



The related |FRAME: Lewis-a-epitope| is formed by &alpha;(1,4) fucosylation of the N-acetylglucosaminyl residue of |FRAME: beta-Gal-13-beta-GlcNac-R|, which can also lead to formation of |FRAME: Type-1-H-Antigen| by &alpha;(1,2) fucosylation at its terminal galactosyl residue.



Both the |FRAME: CPD-8594| and the |FRAME: Lewis-a-epitope| cannot be further transformed to ABH-type antigens |CITS: [6156588]|.



The carbohydrate moiety of the Lewis x epitope is known as |FRAME: CPD-16475 CD15| (cluster of differentiation 15 antigen).

Green sulfur bacteria can grow at light intensities that are too low to support growth of any other phototroph, up to a million times lower light than normal sunlight |CITS: [Overmann92]|.


Chlorosomes contain about 1,500 bacteriochlorophyll molecules per reaction center. They are filled with 10-30 rod-shaped elements which are oriented parallel to the long axis of the chlorosomes and have a diameter of 10 nm. Each rod consists of a tubular bilayer formed by self-organization of the antenna bacteriochlorophyll molecules. Unlike all other known photosynthetic antenna, in which the chlorophyll molecules are bound to proteins, chlorosomes do not contain accessory proteins. The chlorosomal bacteriochlorophyll pigments are able to self-aggregate due to their unique chemical characteristics.



The bacteriochlorophylls found in chlorosomes are either |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll c"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll d"| or |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll e"|, depending on the species. They all possess a hydroxyl group at the C31 position that allows them to chelate the Mg atom of a neighboring molecule and to interact with the C13-oxo carbonyl group of another neighboring pigment molecule, affording the self-aggregation |CITS: [16121276][19435848][22210764]|. In addition, all of these bacteriochlorophylls lack C-132-methylcarboxyl side chains, which are found in all other (bacterio)chlorophylls but would interfere with the ability to form aggregates |CITS: [16245042]|.



Despite of their names, |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll c"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll d"| and |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll e"| are actually chlorins rather than bacteriochlorins. All three are usually found with an unsaturated farnesyl tail rather than phytyl tails |CITS: [2350541][Borrego99]|, although exceptions have been reported.



In chlorosomes of |FRAME:  TAX-191412| (but not |FRAME: TAX-1106| |CITS: [Risch79][3442679]|) all three types of bacteriochlorophyll appear in several forms with different degrees of methylation at the C-82 and C-121 carbons |CITS: [12656478][14610639]|. The variety in methylation is depicted in the structure shown here by the R groups. In general, pimgents produced by cultures grown at lower light intensities are more highly methylated at the C-82 position than pigments produced by cells of the same organism grown at higher light intensities. Different methylation states result in different aggregation properties and light absorbance of the chlorosome, and thus methylation is used as an adaptation to altering envireonmental conditions.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

URM1 also acts as a ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) and is covalently conjugated via an isopeptide bond to lysine residues of certain target proteins in a process that is called urmylation.

The |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones co-chaperone| acts first, by binding to |FRAME: CD-SP-2Fe2S-Complex| (a protein complex that includes |FRAME: L-Cysteine-Desulfurases| and |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins| with an already-assembled [2Fe-2S] cluster), displacing the cysteine desulfurase and forming |FRAME: Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex|.



The co-chaperone guides this complex to the other |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones-ATP chaperone| (an ATPase protein with a pre-bound ATP molecule), where it binds to a nucleotide-binding domain, forming |FRAME: Chap-ATP-Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex "a ternary complex"|.



At this point the complex is ready to transfer its [2Fe�2S] cluster to a receipient. When a suitable acceptor protein approaches the complex one or two of its thiol groups attack the cluster's iron atoms, liberating one or two of the scaffold protein cluster ligands and leading to a conformational change in the co-chaperone that activates the ATPase activity of the main chaperone. Cleavage of the bound ATP leads to an additional conformational change that results in a fundumental change |CITS: [11053447][15485839]|.  A binding site on the ligand binding domain of the chaperone protein opens up and binds the scaffold protein in its disordered state. The conversion of the scaffold protein to its disordered state releases both the Fe-S cluster, which moves to the acceptor protein, and the co-chaperone. 



This is followed by an exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, which restores the chaperone to its active state and releases the scaffold protein, both of which become ready to take part in the next cycle |CITS: [23333622]|.

I. Cytochrome P-450



In cytochrome P-450 the proximal coordinatioin position of the heme iron, which is bound to the 4 nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole ring, is tethered to the protein via a cysteine thiolate ligand. At its rest state, the iron is found at a low-spin ferric state (III valency). At this state the iron also binds a water molecule as a sixth ligand at the distal axial coordination position.



Binding of a substrate to the low-spin ferric enzyme leads to displacement of the water as the sixth ligand and a high spin shift. The substrate-bound complex has a greater reduction potential and more easily accepts a single electron from

the redox partner, which can be either |FRAME: EC-1.6.2.4 "a cytochrome P450 reductase"|, |FRAME: Ferredoxins|, or |FRAME: Cytochromes-b5|).



After the first reduction, the heme iron binds oxygen, forming an oxy-heme complex. The oxygen is bound at the distal axial coordination position, from which the water molecule has been displaced. Following the transfer of the second electron from the redox partner and two subsequent protonations, a peroxo adduct is formed, known as |FRAME: Compound-0|.



Next, the O-O bond is cleaved heterolytically, releasing a water molecule and leaving behind an oxygen atom with only six valence electrons. This highly active oxene oxygen removes one electron from the iron and one from the porphyrin, oxidizing the iron to the unusual valency of IV (ferryl iron) and generating an additional oxidizing equivalent that is delocalized over the porphyrin and thiolate ligands. This ferryl/porphyrin radical cation complex is known as |FRAME: Compound-I| |CITS: [21071661]|.

When the substrate nears the active site, |FRAME: Compound-I| abstracts an electron from it, converting the substrate into a radical and becoming a protonated non-radical ferryl compound known as |FRAME: Compound-II|.



At this point the substrate radical reacts with the oxygen of |FRAME: Compound-II|, forming a new carbon oxygen bond. The product is released, and the iron returns to a valency of III (compound III) |CITS: [OrtizdeMontellano15]|.



II. preoxidases



In peroxidases the proximal coordinatioin position of the heme iron, which is bound to the 4 nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole ring, is tethered to the protein via a histidine residue. |FRAME: Compound-I "Compound I"| is produced when the heme iron is oxidized by |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE|. A single one-electron reduction step of |FRAME: Compound-I| from an electron donor substrate yields |FRAME: Compound-II|, followed by a second one-electron transfer that returns the enzyme to the ferric oxidation state, thus completing the catalytic cycle. Each electron transfer event converts a substrate molecule to a radical cation, forming two such radicals during a catalytic cycle.



In the presence of high concentrations of |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| and the absence of a reducing substrate, |FRAME: Compound-II| can be oxidized to |FRAME: Compound-III|, a catalytically inactive form of the enzyme. |FRAME: Compound-III "Compound III"| is converted back to the resting state by spontaneous autoxidation or by oxidation with two molecules of the substrate radical cation |CITS: [18581264]|.

Binding of a substrate to the low-spin ferric enzyme leads to displacement of the water as the sixth ligand and a high spin shift. The substrate-bound complex has a greater reduction potential and more easily accepts a single electron from

the redox partner, which can be either |FRAME: EC-1.6.2.4 "a cytochrome P450 reductase"|, |FRAME: Ferredoxins|, or |FRAME: Cytochromes-b5|).



After the first reduction, the heme iron binds oxygen, forming an oxy-heme complex. The oxygen is bound at the distal axial coordination position, from which the water molecule has been displaced. Following the transfer of the second electron from the redox partner and two subsequent protonations, a peroxo adduct is formed, known as |FRAME: Compound-0|.



Next, the O-O bond is cleaved heterolytically, releasing a water molecule and leaving behind an oxygen atom with only six valence electrons. This highly active oxene oxygen removes one electron from the iron and one from the porphyrin, oxidizing the iron to the unusual valency of IV (ferryl iron) and generating an additional oxidizing equivalent that is delocalized over the porphyrin and thiolate ligands. This ferryl/porphyrin radical cation complex is known as |FRAME: Compound-I| |CITS: [21071661]|.

When the substrate nears the active site, |FRAME: Compound-I| abstracts an electron from it, converting the substrate into a radical and becoming a protonated non-radical ferryl compound known as |FRAME: Compound-II|.

    rdfs:comment """In this class of regulation, a small molecule directly activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA without requiring the mediation of a regulatory protein.
Typically, a region of the mRNA transcript (recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) acts as a riboswitch or ribosensor and binds the regulating 

molecule directly.  This induces a change in mRNA secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site, or interferes in some other 

way with the translation initiation process.  Alternatively, the small molecule can act by causing or preventing the targeting of the transcript for 

degradation, or by translational attenuation, interacting with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records

the specific regulation mechanism, if known.



In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose

translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be an individual gene).  The regulator will be a small molecule.

    rdfs:comment """The first cytochrome c3 to be discovered |CITS: [13346018]| was a small (13 kDa) tetraheme cytochrome that serves as an electron acceptor for Desulfovibrio hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases (|FRAME: EC-1.12.2.1|) |CITS: [4364940][9849942][16460012]|.


That cytochrome, later described as "cytochrome c3 (Mr = 13,000)", is now classified as |FRAME: TpI-c3| (TpI-c3) |CITS: [5685884][5484445][4358550][Yagi83]|. It belongs to cytochrome class III, has a very low redox potential, and has (so far) been found only in sulfate-reducing bacteria.



The 13 kDa protein, which is the most widespread c-type cytochrome in |FRAME: TAX-194924| species, has been studied more extensively and was shown to be prevalent in the periplasm and to serve as the electron acceptor of periplasmic hydrogenases. The TpI-c3 cytochromes are thought to function as shuttles between the periplasmic dehydrogenases and membrane bound complexes such as |FRAME: CPLX-9771 Qrc| and |FRAME: CPLX-9772 Tmc|/|FRAME: CPLX-9773 Hmc|, which in turn transfer electrons from the periplasm to either the menaquinone pool (in the case of |FRAME: CPLX-9771 Qrc|) |CITS: [20498375]|, or directly to the cytoplasm for sulfate reduction (in the case of |FRAME: CPLX-9772 Tmc|/|FRAME: CPLX-9773 Hmc|) |CITS: [Pereira98][10606770][15950057][16922512]|.



A homodimeric protein that also belongs to this class was later described from some of these organisms, referred to as "cytochrome c3 (Mr = 26,000)" |CITS: [6284155][7830607][9003383][8740362][9485359]|. Even though the subunit size is similar, there is little sequence similarity between the two proteins. The dimeric octaheme 26 kDa protein has been purified from |FRAME: TAX-879| |CITS: [Bruschi69]| and |FRAME: TAX-876| |CITS: [2539120]|, and a crystal structure of the |FRAME: TAX-876| protein has been published |CITS: [8740362]|. The midpoint redox potentials of the four heme groups are -210, -270, -325 and -365mV, respectively |CITS: [2539120]|. The role of the 26 kDa cytochrome is still not clear. It has been shown to interact with cytoplasmic hydrogenases in vitro, but since the cytochrome is thought to be localized in the periplasm |CITS: [5017697]|, it is not clear whether this observation is relevant physiologically |CITS: [6093686][2660909]|. 



A third type, a membrane-bound cytochrome c3 named type II cytochrome c3 (TpII-c3), was reported from |FRAME: TAX-873| |CITS: [8573595]| and |FRAME: TAX-881| |CITS: [11948878]|. It was later shown to be a subunit of the |FRAME: CPLX-9772| |CITS: [16922512]|.



Some hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases (e.g. |FRAME: CPLX-9763 FDH-3|) have a dedicated cytochrome c3 subunit |CITS: [8566699][Costa97][15077118]|.

|CITS: [6354265]|. The citrate molecule is very stable, and needs to be activated prior to cleavage by

forming a thioester bond with the enzyme.



The enzyme is a complex of three subunits (in a 6:6:6 configuration), one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein (acp).

It is synthesized in an apo form, and is converted to its holo form by the covalent binding of the unusual prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to the [acp] component, resulting in |FRAME: HOLO-CITRATE-LYASE|. However, this holo form is still not fully active - in order to be active, the prosthetic group needs to be acetylated, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: G6344|-encoded |FRAME: CITC-MONOMER|, which generates |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|.



The &alpha; subunit of the |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| is a citrate-[acp] transferase that catalyzes the exchange of the bound acetyl group with a citrate molecule, generating |FRAME: Citrate-Lyase-Citryl-Form| and releasing an |FRAME: ACET| molecule.

The &beta; subunit, which is a citryl-[acp] lyase, catalyzes the subsequent step, cleaving the bound citryl group, releasing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and regenerating |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|. Since the active form is regenrated, the enzyme can continuously catalyze the cleavage reaction.

Most DNA ligases catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester bond between a 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate ends of DNA strands, and require ATP, although some forms require GTP, NAD, or ADP instead of ATP) (see |FRAME: EC-6.5.1.1|, |FRAME: EC-6.5.1.2|, |FRAME: EC-6.5.1.6| and |FRAME: EC-6.5.1.7|).



The reaction proceeds in three steps:



1. Adenylation/guanylylation of a lysine residue in the active center of the enzyme, with the concomitant release of pyrophosphate



2. Transfer of the adenylate/guanylate group to the 5' phosphate of the donor strand, forming a temporary A (or G)-5'-pp-5'-(deoxynucleotide)-[DNA] cap.



3. An attack by the 3'-hydroxyl end of the acceptor strand on the A (or G)-5'-pp-5'-(deoxynucleotide)-[DNA] cap, leading to release of the adenylate/guanylate and formation of a phosphodiester bond between the two substrate fragments.

For example, dolichols from certain halobacteria contain an additional saturation in the terminal (omega) isoprene unit |CITS: [9363431][21091511]|.


The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaea prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.



The main function of dolychols is to act as a membrane anchor for the formation of oligosaccharides, which are then transferred to certain asparagine residues within proteins through a modification process known as |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS "N-glycosylation"|. In eukaryotes dolichol is also involved in the transfer of some of the monosaccharides to the forming oligosaccharide.



Dolichols are the major lipid component (14% by mass) of human substantia nigra |FRAME: CPD-12419| |CITS: [15686500]|.

The signal peptide possesses positively charged amino acid residues in the N-terminal region and uncharged amino acids in the central hydrophobic region and contains a characteristic consensus sequence called the lipobox in the C-terminal region. The lipobox sequence is Leu-(Ala/Ser)-(Gly/Ala)-Cys, where the first three residues form the C-terminus of the signal peptide. During maturation the signal peptide is removed by cleavage between the (Gly/Ala) and Cys residues, so that the cysteine residue becomes the N-terminal residue.


Due to its hydrophobic region, the signal peptide is embedded in the inner membrane, thus attaching the prolipoprotein to the membrane. In Gram negative bacteria, it is facing the perisplasmic side.



The first step in the maturation of lipoprotein involves the formation of a thioether linkage between the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine residue and diacylglycerol, while still embedded in the membrane. The two fatty acids connected to the diacylglycerol are also inserted into the membrane, resulting in three membrane anchors (the two fatty acids and the signal peptide).

For example, dolichols from certain halobacteria contain an additional saturation in the terminal (omega) isoprene unit.


The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaebacteria prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.

    rdfs:comment """In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".



Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".



While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.



Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).

In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.



In many cases, purified enzymes can act in vitro using an artificial electron carrier, and their in vivo electron carrier is not known. The classes of "unknown electron carriers" are used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.

electrons between substrates, which are thus involved in redox

usually take place at membranes, because a key purpose of ETRs is to

use the electron energy to build up a proton gradient across the

membrane, which can then be used for energy generation by the cell,

using ATP synthesis driven by the proton gradient.  ETRs very often

involve the pool of membrane-bound quinone substrates, which can

shuttle electrons to or from an ETR.



All ETRs are composite reactions, because they involve at least two

redox half reactions.  These half reactions involve explicit

electrons, which cannot occur freely. Thus, the half reactions have to

be paired up, with the result that the electrons are used only

internally to connect the half reactions, and are not visible

as substrates of the ETR.



Sometimes, a proton transport reaction can also be a sub-reaction of

the ETR, to represent so-called vectoral proton movement.  In the

vectoral case, protons are actively pumped across the membrane, using

energy extracted from the redox processes.  The proton transport

reaction is not directly connected to the redox half reactions in the

pathway representation of the composite reaction.



Because ETRs tend to occur at membranes, substrates that are not in

the default compartment (the cytoplasm) need to have compartment

information associated by means of value annotations.  The exception

to this are the membrane-bound quinone substrates, which are always

assumed to reside in the membrane itself.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates as well as some insects, suggesting that estrogenic sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history. The estrogens that occur naturally in the body are steroids, however other types of molecules acquired in the diet are known to bind to the estrogen receptors and are thus also considered estrogens. They include molecules produced by plants (phytoestrogens), molecules produced by fungi (mycoestrogens), and synthetic compounds (xenoestrogens).



The main steroidal |FRAME: Estrogens estrogens| in humans are |FRAME: ESTRONE|, |FRAME: CPD-352| and |FRAME: ESTRIOL|, which differ in the number of hydroxyl groups (one for |FRAME: ESTRONE|, two for |FRAME: CPD-352| and three for |FRAME: ESTRIOL|). |FRAME: CPD-352| is about 10 times as potent as |FRAME: ESTRONE| and about 80 times as potent as |FRAME: ESTRIOL| in its estrogenic effect.

This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H4PteGlu1, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.



Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.



The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.



The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.



This class stands for 10-formyltetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.

Primates, including humans, lack Fs synthase activity, and have naturally occurring Fs antibodies in plasma.

Primates and humans have a gene that encodes the Fs synthase, but it encodes an inactive protein |CITS: [10506200]|. In individuals that do express the Fs antigen, the |FRAME: HS07505| gene contains a mutation that results in an arginine to glutamine change at residue 296.

    rdfs:comment """Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins contain iron atom(s) ligated by inorganic sulfide and/or at least two cysteinyl (Cys) ligands. The main function of the Fe-S active sites is electron transfer, mostly in the range of low oxidation-reduction potentials.
In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur proteins are also known to participate in the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|. Fe-S active sites are perhaps the most ancient cofactors.



The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)4]2-, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.



Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.



As mentioned above, small electron transfer proteins that contain only mononuclear [Fe(Cys)4]2- complexes are called |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 



Many complex Fe-S proteins contain multiple clusters arranged in chains, separated 1 - 1.4 nm apart, which allow electron transfer across considerable distances. Other electron-transferring groups such as heme or flavin may also be present. Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-7.1.1.2 "complex I"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 "complex II"| and |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.8 "complex III"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 "photosystem I"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 "xanthine dehydrogenase"|.



Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 "4Fe-4S clusters"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.



It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.

It has been recommended to use this term to refer to polysaccharide based mainly on sulfated L-fucose, with less than 10% other monosaccharides |CITS: [12626402]|.


In marine invertebrates, sulfated fucans have been found in the egg jelly coat of sea urchins |CITS: [Vasseur48][8071336]| and in the body wall of sea cucumber |CITS: [3038547]|. In brown algae the fucan is present in the cell walls and can account for more than 40% of the dry weight of isolated cell walls |CITS: [Kloareg84]|. The fucans of brown algae are often called |FRAME: Fucoidans fucoidans|.



The structures of fucans vary among species and sometimes among different parts of the organism |CITS: [Dietrich95]|. Fucan structures can be divided into three main groups: one group, found in |FRAME: TAX-33637| species of brown algae  and several species of sea urchines, has a central chain composed of (1&rarr;3)-linked &alpha;-L-fucopyranose residues |CITS: [8408031]|; a second group, found so far only in the sea urchins |FRAME: TAX-7640| and |FRAME: TAX-7671|, has a central chain composed of (1&rarr;4)-linked &alpha;-L-fucopyranose residues |CITS: [11687579]|; the third group, which includes fucoidan isolated from |FRAME: TAX-52968| and |FRAME: TAX-3011| species of brown algae, has a central chain composed of repeating (1&rarr;3) and (1&rarr;4) linked &alpha;-L-fucopyranose residues |CITS: [11269406][21566795]|. Besides fucose and sulfate, the presence of monosaccharide residues such as mannose, galactose, glucose, xylose and uronic acids were also identified |CITS: [18794778]|.



Several fucose-containing polymers with less than 90% fucosyl residues have also been reported from brown algae and some of them were given names: ascophyllan or xylofucoglycuronan, isolated from |FRAME: TAX-52969|, is based on a backbone of mannuronate with branches of 3-O-D-xylosyl-L-fucose-4-sulfate |CITS: [Larsen66][Kloareg86]|; sargassan or glycuronofucoglycan, also isolated from |FRAME: TAX-52969|, is based on linear chains of D-galactose with branches of L-fucose-3-sulfate or occasionally uronate |CITS: [Percival68][Medcalf78][Kloareg86]|. However, those are classified as sub-types of fucoidan and not fucan, due to the large percentage of non-fucose saccharides.

Fucoidan was first reported in 1913 under the name fucoidin |CITS: [Kylin13]|, but the name was changed in 1959 to  conform with polysaccharide nomenclature |CITS: [McNeely59]|.



Fucoidan structure can be divided into two groups depending on their sources: one group includes |FRAME: TAX-33637| species that have their central chains composed by (1&rarr;3)-linked &alpha;-L-fucopyranose residues |CITS: [8408031]|; a second group includes fucoidan isolated from |FRAME: TAX-52968| and |FRAME: TAX-3011| species that have their central chains composed of repeating (1&rarr;3) and (1&rarr;4) linked &alpha;-L-fucopyranose residues |CITS: [11269406][21566795]|.

Other, generic names in use are F-fucoidan, which consists of mostly fucose |CITS: [23374164]|, U-fucoidan, which contains approximately 20% of glucuronic acid, and G-fucoidan, which contains a substantial amount of galactose |CITS: [20138103]|.



Fucoidan has been reported to possess anti-tumoral |CITS: [Siddhanta01]|, anti-coagulant |CITS: [2804225][2620305][10882718][15962177]|, anti-viral |CITS: [2472775][15386190][9352294][Lapshina06]| and anti-inflamatory activities |CITS: [Siddhanta01]|.

    rdfs:comment """Green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) are proteins that exhibit bright green fluorescence when exposed to light in the blue to ultraviolet range. GFPs form a part of the bioluminesence systems of many marine organisms.


The protein from the jellyfish |FRAME: TAX-6100| was the first GFP to be described |CITS: [13911999]|. In this organism GFP is coupled to the |FRAME: Aequorins aequorin| enzyme, which catalyzes a reaction that forms |FRAME: CPD-20235|. This compound can emit blue light, which can then trigger fluorescence by GFP. However, due to coupling between aequorin and GFP, the short distance enables <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%B6rster_resonance_energy_transfer">F&ouml;rster resonance energy transfer</A> (FRET), a much more efficient, non-radiative energy-transfer process |CITS: [4397528][4151620]|. A similar situation occurs in the soft coral |FRAME: TAX-6136|, where GFP interacts with the luciferase enzyme |CITS: [33175]|.



The protein was first isolated and purified in 1974 |CITS: [4151620]|. A more thorough characterization, including molecular weight, sedimentation coefficient, extinction coefficient, diffusion coefficient, and amino acid composition, was published a few years later |CITS: [28749]|. A cDNA encoding the enzyme was isolated in 1992, suggesting multiple chromosomal genes encoding the protein |CITS: [1347277]|. Cloning and expressing GFP in bacteria and in |FRAME: TAX-6239| has suggeted that GFP could serve as a marker for studying gene expression in vivo |CITS: [8303295][8137953]|.



Several studies have identified the structure of the GFP chromophore, which is produced by autocatalytic cyclization of the tripeptide Ser65-Tyr66-Gly67, which involves dehydration and oxidation by air |CITS: [Shimomura79][Ward80][McCapra88][8448132][9811837]|. It was also shown that the protein undergoes a reversible oxidation-reduction reaction in the presence of molecular oxygen, with only the oxidized form being fluorescent |CITS: [8082767]|.



Over the years GFP has become an extremely useful tool in cell and molecular biology, where it is used as an in situ reporter of expression. The scientists Roger Y. Tsien, Osamu Shimomura, and Martin Chalfie were awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein.

The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif |CITS: [17089213]|.



Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However, unlike thioredoxins glutaredoxins can utilize the thiols from GSH in solution together with the glutaredoxin N-terminal cysteine in a mechanism that is called the monothiol mechanism.



Proteins that belong to the monothiol glutaredoxins include a CGFS motif in their active-site.

The group includes such proteins as yeast GRX3, GRX4 and GRX5, and E. coli GRX4 |CITS: [11898418]|.



Studies with yeast showed that GRX5, a mitochondrial monothiol glutaredoxin, is involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters |CITS: [12970193][11950925]|.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

The galactomannan attached to N-glycans in |FRAME: TAX-746128| is composed of a linear mannan core comprising |FRAME: CPD-20116 "&alpha;-(1-2)-linked mannotetraose"| repeating units attached to each other via &alpha;-(1-6) linkages and decorated by side chains of &beta;-(1-5)-galactofuranose units, which are linked to the C2 position of the non-reducing mannose residue in each mannotetraose unit |CITS: [7960122]|.



The length of the side chains depends on growth conditions. Cells grown in YPD medium produced galactomannan with side chain consisting an average of 3-4 units of galactofuranose |CITS: [7960122][25187160]|, while cells grown in YNB medium incorporated on average 10 Galf units that may contain one &beta;-(1,6) linkage midchain |CITS: [25187160]|.

    rdfs:comment """Glycogen is a highly branched glucose polymer found in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. It resembles plant-produced |FRAME: Starch starch| and is sometimes called "animal starch". Glycogen serves multiple functions, including energy reserve, osmotic regulation, blood glucose homeostasis, and pH maintenance.


Glycogen is formed of small chains of 8 to 12 glucose molecules linked together by &alpha; (1->4) bonds. These small chains, also known as |FRAME: Maltodextrins maltodextrins|, are in turn linked together by &alpha; (1->6) bonds. The &alpha;-1,4 linkages make up approximately 95% of the total molecule.  The &alpha;-1,6 branches accounts for 7&ndash;10% of the linkages and are evenly distributed within the glycogen particle.



Since each chain (with the exception of the outer unbranched chains) supports two branches, glycogen particles grow spherically by adding tiers (a tier corresponds to the spherical space separating two consecutive branches from all chains located at similar distance from the center of the particle).



Two structural levels of glycogen particles have been reported, which are tightly associated with their physiological functions: small quasi-spherical &beta; particles, as found in muscle cells, and large rosette-shaped &alpha; particles, as found in liver cells. The diameter of &beta; particles normally range from 10 to 50 nm, with an average at around 20&mdash;30 nm. The &beta; particles can stick together to form large &alpha; particles with diameters up to

300 nm |CITS: [20196533][31244022][33996916]|. Two types of &alpha; particles have been observed: fragile and dense particles, which comprise large and dense &beta; particles with long average chain length, and stable light particles, which comprise smaller, compact &beta; particles with short average chain length |CITS: [31244022]|.



Mathematical modelling predicts a maximal size for the &beta; particle beyond which further growth is impossible, as there would not be sufficient space for interaction of the chains with the catalytic sites of glycogen metabolism enzymes. The predicted upper limit is a particle consisting of 12 tiers corresponding to a 42 nm maximal diameter and including about 55,000 glucose residues. 36% of this total number rests in the outer (unbranched) shell and is thus readily accessible to glycogen catabolism without the need for debranching |CITS: [12179957]|.



Although glycogen and starch are two distinct physical states of the same type of storage polysaccharide, starch is solid semi-crystalline while glycogen particles are entirely hydrosoluble |CITS: [21220783]|.

here as a superatom.  The synonym for this structure was named using the IUPAC name generator (Preferred

IUPAC Name) in MarvinSketch version 5.0 from ChemAxon.  Note that these names do not take into account the

thioester linkage between the phosphopantetheinyl arm of the holo-acyl carrier protein and the amino acid.

These fucosylated structures are found not only on blood cells but also on many other cell types (mainly epithehal), and it has been suggested that they should be called histo-blood group antigens.



The majority of the A, B and H antigens are linked to the ends of long polylactosamine chains attached mainly to band 3 protein (encoded by SLC4A1), the anion exchange protein of the red blood cells. A minor fraction of the antigens is attached to a ceramide moiety, forming neutral glycosphingolipids.



Several H antigens exist, differing in their core disaccharide |CITS: [2093726]|. The different types are:



|FRAME: Type-1-H-Antigen "Type 1"|: &alpha;Fuc-(1,2)-&beta;Gal-(1&rarr;3)-&beta;GlcNac-(1&rarr;R)



|FRAME: Type-2-H-Antigen "Type 2"|: &alpha;Fuc-(1,2)-&beta;Gal-(1&rarr;4)-&beta;GlcNac-(1&rarr;R)



|FRAME: Type-3-H-Antigen "Type 3"|: &alpha;Fuc-(1,2)-&beta;Gal-(1&rarr;3)-&alpha;GalNac-(1&rarr;R)

|FRAME: Type-6-H-Antigen "Type 6"|: &alpha;Fuc-(1,2)-&beta;Gal-(1&rarr;4)-&beta;Glc-(1&rarr;R)



Most of the H antigens found in the cell are either type 1 or type 2, followed by type 3 and 4. Type 1 is found in secretions and in the serum, while type 2 is found exclusively on the surface of red blood cells. Type 6 molecules have been described in exocrine secretions. It is not clear if type 5 H antigens exist, although the type 5 precursor has been characterized |CITS: [2093726]|.

The term "|FRAME: HEME_C|" has been used to describe the heme group attached to |FRAME: Cytochromes-c "c-type cytochromes"|.

Since the modifications that define the heme c molecule are generated by its attachment to the protein, it does not naturally occur in a free form.

At least seven gene products are involved in the maturation of hydrogenases in |FRAME: TAX-562|, which includes the generation and incorporation of the CN ligand from |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| (CP). First, HypF converts CP and ATP to |FRAME: CPD-15424|, inorganic phosphate, pyrophosphate, and AMP |CITS: [12377778]|. It then transfers the carbamoyl group to the carboxy terminal cysteine of HypE |CITS: [12586941]|. During the carbamoyl transfer reaction, HypE and HypF form a tight stoichiometric complex |CITS: [15291820]|. HypE then catalyzes the ATP hydrolysis-dependent dehydration of the carbamate group to a cyanate group |CITS: [15291820][12586941]| which is transferred to the HypC-HypD complex |CITS: [15504408]| and from there to the hydrogenase.

HypE forms a homodimer via a disulfide bridge formed by the C-terminal cysteine residue |CITS: [15291820]|. The dimeric structure is stabilized by a pseudo-&beta;-barrel formed by interactions between the domain A from each protomer. The HypE dimer forms a ternary structure with two molecules of the |FRAME: HypCD-Dimer "HypC/HypD heterodimer"|, with the two HypCD complexes attaching to both side faces of the HypE dimer |CITS: [32227866]|. The HypCDE ternary complex formation causes the HypE C-terminal tail to adopt an outward conformation, which is favorable for the cyanide transfer |CITS: [32227866]|. It is still not known how exactly is a second cyano group transferred from HypE to the cofactor precursor.

Like other NSAID drugs (e.g. |FRAME: CPD-524| and |FRAME: CPD-7669|), ibuprofen works by inhibiting the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.14.99.1| (also known as cyclooxygenase or COX) that converts |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| to |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2|, a precursor to other prostaglandins that mediate pain, inflammation, and fever. In addition, |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2| is also a precursor of |FRAME: ALPHA11-ALPHA-EPOXY-15-HYDROXYTHROMBA|, which stimulates platelet aggregation. The inhibition of the COX1 variant of the COX cyclooxygenase also reduces the formation of blood clots.

Ibuprofen inhibits both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, |FRAME: HS01815| (COX1) and |FRAME: HS01115| (COX2).



Ibuprofen was derived from |FRAME: PROPIONATE| during the 1960s. Originally marketed as Brufen, ibuprofen is available under a variety of popular trademarks, including Motrin, Nurofen, Advil, Nuprin and many others.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

Many forms exist, based on the structure of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "Jasmonate"| (jasmonic acid, JA). The jasmonates act as regulatory molecules in many developmental processes that include fertility, sex determination, root elongation and fruit ripening. They are also potent signals activating plant defences against pathogens, herbivory, wounding and abiotic stress.


The jasmonate regulation system includes the COI1 receptor protein and several JAZ (JAsmonate ZIM domain) repressors, which, in the absence of jasmonate, are bound to the MYC2 transcription factors, preventing transcription. In the presence of active jasmonate molecules, COI1 interacts with the JAZ repressors, causing their |FRAME: PWY-7511 ubiquitylation|. The ubiquitylated repressors are targeted for proteasome degradation, releasing the MYC2 transcription factors and activating transcription |CITS: [19716757]|.



Only two of the four stereoisomers of jasmonate occur naturally: |FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But, in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|. The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|.

However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|.

Members of this family are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive activator (component A) and a dehydratase (component D). Component A is a homodimer with one [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster bound in the dimer interface, while component D is a heterodimer with 1-2 [4Fe&ndash;4S] clusters and FMN. In order to catalyze the reaction, the dehydratase requires one high-energy electron that transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion, facilitating the elimination of the hydroxyl group. The electron needs to be supplied only once, before the first reaction takes place, since it is regenerated at the end of each reaction cycle. This initial activation is provided by the activator. 



The activator, which has been named |FRAME: CPLX-9330 archerase| because its open position resembles an archer shooting arrows, binds two ADP molecules. Upon the reduction of its [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster by a single electron, delivered by a dedicated flavodoxin, the two ADP molecules exchange for two ATP molecules, resulting in a large conformational change. The change results in the activator binding to the dehydratase component, upon which the two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed and the electron is transferred to the dehydratase, activating it |CITS: [15374661][18337824]|.

During the formation of the secondary cell wall, lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between the |FRAME: CELLULOSE|, |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|, and |FRAME: Pectin pectin| components, driving out water and strengthening the wall.



Lignin is heterogeneous, and lacks a defined primary structure. The illustration below is meant to provide a general concept rather than describe an exact structure.



The main basic monomers (known as monolignols) are the phenylpropanoids |FRAME: COUMARYL-ALCOHOL|, |FRAME: CONIFERYL-ALCOHOL|, and |FRAME: SINAPYL-ALCOHOL| (see |FRAME: PWY-361|). The composition and relative abundance of the lignols differ among different organisms. The monolignols are glycosylated for the purpose of transport to the lignification zone, but the glucose moiety is removed prior to polymerization (see |FRAME: PWY-83|).

The biosynthesis of lignin is not well understood. It consists of radical-radical coupling, and is catalyzed by oxidative enzymes (peroxidases and/or laccases). Lignin is covalently linked to the hemicellulose fibers, and thus crosslinks different components of the cell wall, conferring mechanical strength.



Lignin can be degraded by certain fungi and bacteria that produce the enzymes |FRAME: MANGANESE-PEROXIDASE-RXN "manganese peroxidase"|, |FRAME: RXN-17136 "lignin peroxidase"| and |FRAME: CELLOBIOSE-DEHYDROGENASE-ACCEPTOR-RXN "cellobiose dehydrogenase"|.

    rdfs:comment """The broad definition of a |FRAME: Lipoproteins lipoprotein| is a protein to which lipids are bound. Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesins, and toxins are lipoproteins, including the high-density (HDL) and low-density (LDL) lipoproteins that carry fats in the blood stream.


Eukaryotic and prokaryotic lipoproteins are quite different. Eukaryotic lipoproteins are complex particles with a central core containing cholesterol esters and triglycerides, surrounded by free cholesterol and phospholipids, and serve to transport these lipids in aqueous media such as blood plasma or other extracellular fluids. Plasma lipoproteins are divided into seven classes based on size, lipid composition, and apolipoproteins. These groups are chylomicrons (ULDL), chylomicron remnants, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)].



Prokaryotic lipoproteins, on the other hand, are lipoylated at their N-terminal by a single lipid molecule. Membrane-attached lipoproteins of Gram-negative bacteria and Mycobacteria are tethered to the membrane by an N-acyl-(S-diacylglyceryl)-cysteine anchor that is variably acylated depending on the genus. In many Gram-positive bacteria certain variations exist (see below). The lipoprotein known as |FRAME: CPLX0-8279| (Lpp) is considered the most abundant protein in |FRAME: TAX-562| and accounts for more than 40% of the peptidoglycan on a weight basis. It is necessary for the stabilization and integrity of the bacterial cell envelope and is thought to physically tether the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan layer. The lipoylation of its N-terminus allows its attachment to the outer membrane |CITS:[4899922][4565677][4578317]|.



In bacteria all lipoproteins are initially translated as precursors (|FRAME: Prolipoproteins prolipoproteins|) containing an N-terminal signal peptide that contains a conserved lipobox motif sequence preceding a cysteine residue |CITS: [12876315][19367716]|. Once transported to the outer face of the membrane, |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.145| (Lgt) attaches a diacylglycerol moiety from a phospholipid donor by a thioether bond to the cysteine residue |CITS: [8051048]|.

In most organisms |FRAME: EC-3.4.23.36| (Lsp) then cleaves the leader peptide leaving the cysteine as the N-terminal amino acid of the protein |CITS: [7040395]|. However, it has been found that in |FRAME: TAX-2115| the peptide is cleaved two amino acids away from the cysteine (towards the N-terminus) |CITS: [22303020]|.

In Gram-negative bacteria biosynthesis is completed by |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.269| (Lnt), which transfers a fatty acid from a membrane phospholipid to form an amide linkage with the N-terminus of the cysteine residue, generating a triacylated molecule |CITS: [2032623]|.



More variety is found in some low GC Gram-positive bacteria. Three new forms have been observed - a |FRAME: Peptidyl-Form-Lipoprotein-N-terminus "peptidyl form"| (which results from the alternative cleaving by Lsp, with two amino acids present before the lipid-modified cysteine residue, which is described above), an |FRAME: N-Acetyl-Lipoprotein "N-acetyl form"|, and an N-acylated monoacyl-glyceryl form known as the |FRAME: Lyso-Form-Lipoprotein-Cysteine "lyso-form"| |CITS: [22135097][22303020][28320885]|.

The i antigen undergoes gradual conversion to the I antigen in newborn infants, a process that completes in about 18 months.


Both antigens are based entirely on Type 2 (|FRAME: BETA-D-GALACTOSYL-ETCETERA-GLUCOSAMINE "N-acetyllactosamine"|) chains. The basic i structure is an unbranched polylactosamine comprising at least two N - acetyllactosamine units connected by a &beta;(1&rarr;3) linkage |CITS: [823020][22356451]|.

The crucial step in the transition from the i antigen to the I antigen is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.150|, also known as the I-branching enzyme, which introduces the branching by adding a GlcNAc residue by a &beta;(1&rarr;6) linkage to the galactose residue to which other residues are already attached by a 1,3 linkage |CITS: [6490658]|.

Note that the structure shown here is the core structure that defines I antigenicity. Most i antigens are further glycosylated.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.


There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with a bound L-lysyl group.

Malonate decarboxylase is an enzyme complex composed of three subunits, one of which is a dedicated acyl-carrier protein (acp).

    rdfs:comment """Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation. Menaquinones are the most widespread respiratory quinones in biological systems |CITS: [Fujimoto12]|. Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-n or DMK-n, respectively, where the n refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.


Many bacteria and archaea have |FRAME: Dihydromenaquinones "dehydrogenated menaquinones"|, which are named MK-n(H2). The degree and location of dehydrogenation depends on the species. Some organisms have menaquinones with modifications of the head group, for example |FRAME: TAX-2302| possess both |FRAME: CPD-15875 thermoplasmaquinones| (TPQ), which contains an extra methyl group, and |FRAME: CPD-15876 methionaquinones| (MTK), which contains a methylthio group |CITS: [11157962]|.



Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K2. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.



The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K1 (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K2 (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lengths there are many variations of vitamin K2, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K2(45).



The reduced form of menaquinone is called |FRAME: Menaquinols|.

MAP kinases are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis |CITS: [11294822]|.



MAP kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to be active, they need to be phosphorylated. Most of the MAP kinases belong to the "classical MAP kinases" family and need to be phosphorylated on two amino acids, a threonine and a tyrosine, which are found in a TxY motif at the activation loop. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine precedes phosphorylation of the threonine.



Some MAP kinases are atypical and require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated.

N-acetylneuraminate, the most ubiquitous species amongst the sialic acids, is widely distributed in the

animal kingdom as a component of oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids.

N-acetylneuraminate carries out various biological functions by acting as receptors for

microorganisms, viruses, toxins, and hormones, by masking receptors, and by regulation of the immune

system.



N-acetylneuraminic acid is the predominant form of sialic acid present in humans. It can be found as a terminal sugar on a wide range of surface glycoconjugates |CITS: [11841250]|. The &alpha;-anomer is the form that is found when sialic acid is bound to glycans, but in solution it exists mainly (over 90%) in the &beta;-anomeric form |CITS: [18063573]|. 



A number of bacteria that can colonize humans make use of N-acetylneuraminic acid as a nutrient source. In addition, some pathogens such as |FRAME: TAX-727| use sialic acid in an immune evasion mechanism by adding N-acetylneuraminic acid to their lipopolysaccharide |CITS: [12180977][10447878]|, which provides increased survival in human serum. Most of these organisms are not capable of synthesizing N-acetylneuraminic acid and import it into the cells |CITS: [16262798]| after conversion (either spontaneous or enzymatic) to the &beta;-anomer |CITS: [18063573]| .

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: Sphingomyelins Sphingomyelins| are a type of |FRAME: SPHINGOLIPIDS sphingolipids| found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath that surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-CHOLINE| and |FRAME: Ceramides|, but |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-ETHANOLAMINE| can replace |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-CHOLINE|.


Sphingomyelins are found in all tissues and lipoproteins; for example, they account for ~5% of the lipid phosphate in liver and 25% in pancreas |CITS: [2187537]|. Sphingomyelins have a function in signal transduction |CITS: [8086039]|.  



Sphingomyelins are highly enriched in the plasma membrane of cells, and were considered to be found largely in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane |CITS: [2187537]|. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2, an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelins into ceramides, has been found to localize exclusively to the inner leaflet, further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there.



Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=257200">Niemann-Pick Disease</A>. The disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sphingomyelinase, rsulting in accumulation of sphingomyelin in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of several cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.


During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H2PteGlu1. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H4PteGlu1, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.



Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.



The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.



The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.



Among the many folates |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF "(6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate"| is the most enigmatic compound involved in the folate biosynthesis. |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF| is the only folate derivative that does not serve as a cofactor in C1-metabolism, but it is the most frequent and stable form of folates found in plants |CITS: [8480361]|. Moreover, |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF| is known to inhibit most of the folate dependent enzymes at physiological concentrations. The biological role of this compound is still poorly understood but it has been discussed as factor involved in the regulation of essential biosynthetic steps such as the formation of serine during photorespiration |CITS: [15888445][12207015]|.



This class stands for (6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.

The attachment of NEDD8 to proteins is known as neddylation |CITS: [8395831][9353319]|.


Like ubiquitin, the NEDD8 proteins end with two glycine residues. |FRAME: NEDD8-activating-proteins-E1 "An [E1 NEDD8-activating enzyme]"|, which is a heterodimer composed of APPBP1 and UBA3 subunits, activates NEDD8 in an ATP-dependent reaction by forming a high-energy thiolester intermediate between NEDD8 and a cystein residue |CITS: [14690597]|. The activated NEDD8 is subsequently transferred to  to a cysteine residue of |FRAME: NEDD8-carrier-proteins-E2| (such as the human UBE2M and UBE2F), and is eventually conjugated to a lysine residue of specific substrates in the presence of the appropriate E3 ligases.



The primary known substrates of NEDD8 modification are the |FRAME: Cullins cullin| subunits of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which become activated by this modification. Neddylation results in covalent conjugation of a NEDD8 moiety onto a conserved cullin lysine residue |CITS: [15021886]|.



Several different proteases, including the human UCHL1, UCHL3, USP21, COP9 , and NEDP1, can remove NEDD8 from its protein conjugates.

The minimal NRPS module consists of condensation, adenylation, and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains.



The adenylation domain recognizes and activates the amino acid substrate through the formation of an aminoacyl adenylate, followed by covalent binding of the activated amino acid as a thioester to the |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| of the PCP domain. The condensation domain catalyzes peptide-bond formation between 2 adjacent modules by facilitating the attack of an upstream peptidyl-PCP donor by a downstream chain-elongation unit, an aminoacyl-PCP acceptor nucleophile.



PCPs are not limited to NRPSs. For example, D-alanyl carrier protein (Dcp) is a discrete PCP that contributes to the peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, and is required for the formation of D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid |CITS: [18059524]|.

General Background 



Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible interconversion of protons, electrons and  |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE|, resulting in |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE| oxidation to two protons or in the reverse direction, molecular hydrogen production by the reduction of protons.



Most hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that contain iron-sulfur clusters. They have been subdivided into two main classes based on the composition of two metal atoms at their active center: |FRAME: NiFe-hydrogenases "[NiFe] hydrogenases"| and |FRAME: FeFe-hydrogenases "[FeFe] hydrogenases"|. These two classes are phylogenetically distinct. It should be noted that in some of the [NiFe] hydrogenases one of the Ni-bound cysteine residues is replaced by selenocysteine. Those enzymes are known as [NiFeSe] hydrogenases. The [FeFe] hydrogenases usually have high catalytic activity, but are sensitive to irreversible inactivation by |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE|, more so than [NiFe] hydrogenases. 



While [FeFe] hydrogenases are limited to certain bacteria and a few unicellular eukaryotes, [NiFe] hydrogenases are widespread in both bacteria and archaea |CITS: [20463892]|. 



[NiFe] hydrogenases are usually heterodimeric proteins, but can be associated with additional subunits.The large subunit contains a |FRAME: CPD-24862| at the catalytic site, while the smaller subunit contains 3 FeS clusters.  These clusters transfer electrons from an external electron donor to the |FRAME: CPD-24862| site for reduction of protons |CITS: [20463892]|.



The mechanism by which |FRAME: NiFe-hydrogenases [NiFe]-hydrogenases| oxidize molecular hydrogen involves a number of intermediate states, some of which are still poorly characterized.



The states that have been characterized include several inactive states: the Ni-A and N-B states are observed when the enzyme is is inactivated by oxygen, and the Ni-CO and Ni-SCO states are observed when the enzyme is inactivated by binding CO. The active states include |FRAME: Ni-C Ni-C| (in which the nickel has a valency of III), |FRAME: Ni-R Ni-R| (reduced), and |FRAME: Ni-SIa Ni-SIa| (oxidized) states. These states can be interconverted to one another by one-electron/one-proton equilibria  |CITS: [15157115][15157116][Kaur-Ghumaan14]|.



Although many studies agree on the presence of the three active states, there remains doubt about the completion of the cycle as well as the interconversion between each state |CITS: [28487405]|. One model, in which H2 is added to the |FRAME: Ni-SIa "Ni-SIa state"| |CITS: [19675641]|, is described by the following sub-reactions:

The |FRAME: CPD-18407| precursor is passed from the |FRAME: NifB NifB protein| that produces it to the surface of |FRAME: NifEN apo-NifEN| |CITS: [21551100]|. It is held in place by at least an |FRAME: CYS| residue (Cys&alpha;25 in the protein from |FRAME: TAX-354|) |CITS: [21212358]|.

Molybdenum is transferred by |FRAME: holo-NifQ NifQ|, which carries it as part of a different molybdenum-iron-sulfur cluster (which is only used as a molybdenum donor to the nitrogenase |FRAME: CPD-41|) |CITS: [18697929]|, and |FRAME: HOMO-CIT|, produced by |FRAME: G-44194 NifV|, is transferred by an unknown mechanism that involves NifH |CITS: [9294461]|.



The resulting M-cluster is then relocated from the surface to the binding site within NifEN. In the enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-354| the M-cluster is held in its new place by interactions with Cys250 and Asn418, and the homocitrate is anchored by interactions with Arg402. The complex carrying the fully functional M-cluster is referred to as |FRAME: NifEN-M-cluster "a holo-NifEN"| |CITS: [21212358]|. 



Despite the incomplete knowledge, it has clearly been shown that Mo and homocitrate are incorporated into the precursor while it is bound to NifEN, and that this cluster is transformed into a fully matured |FRAME: CPD-41| and inserted into its target location in the MoFe protein (the NifDK component of the nitrogenase complex) without the aid of a carrier or chaperone |CITS: [17050696]|.



The structure shown below depicts Cys25, which interacts with the L-cluster, and Cys250 and Asn418, which interact with the M-cluster.

Lipopolysaccharides contain three parts: a lipid (|FRAME: Lipid-A "lipid A"|), a |FRAME: LPS-Core-Oligosaccharides "core oligosaccharide"|, and polysaccharide side chains known as the O-antigen.



The composition of the O-antigen varies among different strains, but in general it consists of |FRAME: O-Antigen-Repeat-Units "repeating oligosaccharide subunits"| made up of two to eight sugar residues. At least 20 different sugars are known to occur, and many of these sugars are unique dideoxyhexoses that are rarely found elsewhere in nature. The variations in sugar content of the O-antigens contribute to the wide variety of antigenic types between species and even strains of Gram-negative bacteria |CITS: [12007641]|.



The presence or absence of O chains determines whether the LPS is considered smooth or rough, respectively. In addition, particular sugars in the structure, especially the terminal ones, confer immunological specificity of the O-antigen, in addition to the "smoothness" of the strain.

Ginsenosides are composed of an aglycone and sugar moieties. Based on the structure of their aglycones, ginsenosides have been categorized into three broad types; |FRAME: Protopanaxadiol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides"| (PPD), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 20, |FRAME: Protopanaxatriol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides"| (PPT), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 6 and 20, and |FRAME: Oleanonic-acid-type-ginsenosides "oleanonic-acid-type saponins"|.



Although ginsenosides only have three kinds of aglycones, more than 60 kinds of ginsenosides have been identified by now due to the variability in the type of sugar moieties, their number, and the carbon positions they link to.



The biological activity of ginsenoside increases with the decrease of the number of the sugar moieties. All of the ginsenosides found in large quantities in wild ginseng (known as major ginsenosides) are heavily glycosylated, while the more active less-glycosylated ginsenosides are found in much smalller quantities (and are commonly referred to as the

minor ginsenosides). Following oral intake of ginseng, the large low-solubility and poor-permeability major ginsenosides cannot be absorbed by the human body directly |CITS: [Su06]|, and are deglycosylated into smaller forms in the gastrointestinal tract by intestinal bacteria and/or digestive enzymes |CITS: [8923812]|.



Glycosidase enzymes that can convert the major ginsenosides to minor ginsenosides are not common and are of commercial interest.

General Background 



Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible interconversion of protons, electrons and  |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE|, resulting in |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE| oxidation to two protons or in the reverse direction, molecular hydrogen production by the reduction of protons.



Most hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that contain iron-sulfur clusters. They have been subdivided into two main classes based on the composition of two metal atoms at their active center: [NiFe] hydrogenases and [FeFe] hydrogenases. These two classes are phylogenetically distinct. It should be noted that in some of the [NiFe] hydrogenases one of the Ni-bound cysteine residues is replaced by selenocysteine. Those enzymes are known as [NiFeSe] hydrogenases. The [FeFe] hydrogenases usually have high catalytic activity, but are sensitive to irreversible inactivation by |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE|, more so than [NiFe] hydrogenases. 



While [FeFe] hydrogenases are limited to certain bacteria and a few unicellular eukaryotes, [NiFe] hydrogenases are widespread in both bacteria and archaea |CITS: [20463892]|. 



 [NiFe] hydrogenases are usually heterodimeric proteins, but can be associated with additional subunits.The large subunit contains the [NiFe] catalytic site, while the smaller subunit contains 3 FeS clusters.  These clusters transfer electrons from an external electron donor to the [NiFe] site for reduction of protons |CITS: [20463892]|.

Many [FeFe]-hydrogenases are monomeric but possess additional domains that contain FeS clusters |CITS: [18500479]|. The catalytic core of [FeFe] hydrogenases is a single domain of about 350 residues that accommodates the active site known as the H cluster.



In addition, a third class of hydrogenases is found in some methanogenic archaea. These enzymes contain only a mononuclear Fe active site and no FeS clusters, and are known as [Fe] hydrogenases.

In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12| |CITS: [11687213]|


Unlike ferredoxin, flavodoxins contain a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"| (FMN) cofactor. They exist in three redox states: in an |FRAME: Oxidized-flavodoxins "oxidized form"|, as a |FRAME: Flavodoxins-Semiquinones semiquinone|, or as the fully-reduced |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins hydroquinone|. The complexion of the cofactor FMN involves two distinct mechanisms in flavodoxins. The phosphoribityl part of the molecule is bound by hydrogen bonds, while the isoalloxazine ring is kept in place mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The phosphate group is bound by a loop that contains the key fingerprint motif for flavodoxins, T/S-X-T-G-X-T |CITS: [10610791]|. 



Flavodoxins can be divided into two structural classes: short-chain flavodoxins with ~150 residues and long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ~20 amino-acid residues interrupting the final strand of &beta;-sheet.



Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+

reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.



Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. In many organisms, including cyanobacteria and anaerobes, Fld can substitute for Fd under conditions of iron deprivation.

The P in the name comes from the  fact that these enzymes catalyze the auto-phosphorylation of a key conserved aspartate residue within the pump


The P-type ATPase Superfamily is classified as TC 3.A.3 in the Transporter Classification Database |CITS: [24225317]|. Most members of this superfamily catalyze cation uptake and/or efflux, although one subfamily (TC 3.A.3.8) is involved in flipping phospholipids across the membrane.



P-type ATPases have a single catalytic subunit of 70 - 140 kDa. This catalytic subunit hydrolyzes ATP, contains the aspartyl phosphorylation site and binding sites for the transported ligand(s), and catalyzes ion transport. However, enzymes from some subfamilies (e.g. P1A, P2A, P2C and P4 ATPases) also need additional subunits that are involved in trafficking, folding, and regulation.

The RND (Resistance, Nodulation, cell Division) family of integral membrane proteins participate in the formation of chemiosmotic H+-antiporter efflux systems.



RND superfamily members have been classified into nine recognized phylogenetic families, which generally correlate with specific substrate specificity. Family 1 members catalyze export of heavy metals; family 2 members export multiple drugs; family 3 members exprot lipooligosaccharides concerned with plant nodulation for the purpose of symbiotic nitrogen fixation; family 4 members (SecDF proteins) export unfolded proteins; family 5 members export lipids and possibly antibiotic drugs in Gram positive bacteria; family 6 members are eukaryotic proteins that export cholesterol/lipid/steroid hormones; family 7 members export fused pentacyclic ring compounds such a hopanoids; family 8 members export pigments; and family 9 members export cholesterol-modified peptides such as "hedgehog", a sterol sensor in animals. 



Most of the RND superfamily transport systems consist of large polypeptide chains that contain 12 transmembrane domains. A large periplasmic domain is involved in substrate recognition and forms a cavity that can accommodate multiple drugs simultaneously. While RND systems may consist of three, two, or one distinct RND polypeptide chains, most contain only one RND polypeptide. However, the RND members of families 1-3 function in conjunction with a membrane fusion protein (MFP) and an outer membrane factor (OMF), achieving efflux across both membranes of the Gram-negative bacterial cell envelope in a single energy-coupled step.

&Beta;-Lactam antibiotics inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall by the irreversible binding of their four-membered &beta;-lactam ring to the so-called |FRAME: Penicillin-Binding-Proteins "penicillin binding proteins"| (PBPs).

The PBPs are proteins that contain a D,D-peptidase domain, most commonly used for hydrolyzing the |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| bond found in the pentapetide moiety of peptidoglycans. Since the &beta;-lactam moiety of |FRAME: PENICILLIN "penicillins"| is similar to the D-Ala-D-Ala structure, these enzymes bind penicillin irreversibly and become inactive.

Several groups of enzymes belong to this family - carboxypeptidases, transpeptidases, and endopeptidases. The carboxypeptidase remove the terminal |FRAME: D-ALANINE| from the pentapeptide, the transpeptidase form crosslinks between the pentapeptides of adjacent glycan threads, and the endopeptidases hydrolyze these crosslinks.

This irrevesible binding prevents the enzyme from catalyzing the formation of these cross-links, resulting in a defective cell wall and cell death.



Penicillin antibiotics were the first drugs that were effective against many previously serious diseases, such as syphilis, and infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci. They are still widely used today, although more and more types of bacteria have acquired resistance.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

They are analogs of |FRAME: Ubiquinones "ubiquinones"| (Coenzyme Q), with two methyl groups substituting the methoxy groups found in Q. The fully reduced form is called |FRAME: Plastoquinols|.


Plastoquinones are found in the chloroplasts of higher plants, red, brown and green algae, and in cyanobacteria, and are important members of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, where they carry electrons from |FRAME: CPLX490-3506| to the |FRAME: CPLX-9022|. In fact, it has been shown that in cyanobacteria essentially all electron transport through unbound quinones proceeds via PQ in cyanobacterial thylakoids. Apart from PQ the only quinone found in thylakoids is vitamin K1, which is associated with PS I |CITS: [Vermaas01]|.



Plastoquinones also serve as cofactors involved in the desaturation of phytoene in the synthesis of carotenoids (see |FRAME: PWY-6475|).



Plastoquinone was isolated originally in 1946 from alfalfa, but was not identified at the time. It was rediscovered in 1959 and its structure was described in the same year (see |CITS: [7022156]|).



Please note that tyhe structure shown here is that of |FRAME: PLASTOQUINONE-9| and is not accurate for this generic class of compounds, which contains plastoquinones with different side-chain lengths.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: Pectin "Pectin"| is a structural heteropolysaccharide consisting of a complex set of polysaccharides that is present in most primary cell walls and is particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants. It is involved in crosslinking cellulose and hemicellulose fibers, which provides rigidity to the cell wall.
The characteristic structure of pectin is a linear chain of &alpha;-(1-4)-linked |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| that forms the pectin-backbone, |FRAME: 1-4-alpha-D-galacturonosyl|.



Diferent components of pectin have different substitutions and additions. A common type is |FRAME: Rhamnogalacturonans-I "rhamnogalacturonan I"| (RG-I), which makes up 20-35% of pectin. In RG-I some of the |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| units in the backbone are replaced by (1-2)-linked |FRAME: L-rhamnose|, to which side chains of various neutral sugars branch off, mostly |FRAME: D-Galactose|, |FRAME: L-ARABINOSE| and |FRAME: CPD-25028|. Another common type is |FRAME: CPD-14581 "rhamnogalacturonan II"| (RG-II), which makes up about 10% of pectin. RG-II is based on a backbone of 8-9 galacturonate units, which are decorated by four side chains consisting of 12 different types of sugars in more than 20 different linkages. RG-II usually forms dimeric structures via the formation of crosslinks by a 1:2 borate diol ester between apiosyl residues in one of the side chains.



Other types of pectin include chains of |FRAME: Apiogalacturonans apiogalacturonan|, |FRAME: 1-4-alpha-D-galacturonosyl homogalacturonan|, and |FRAME: Xylogalacturonan xylogalacturonan|. There is currently no consensus as to how the pectic polysaccharides are linked to each other, or to other polymers, in the wall. However, it is thought that the different peptides are covalently linked to each other via their backbones, forming a large linear structure with many side branches |CITS: [11423143][12162553][Coenen07]|.



In nature, around 80% of the carboxyl groups of the galacturonate units are esterified with |FRAME: METOH|. Some plants, including sugar beet, potatoes and pears, contain pectins with acetylated galacturonate in addition to methyl esters. 



The salt of partially esterified pectins is called a pectinate, and if the degree of esterification is below 5%, |FRAME: PECTATE|.



Pectin is used in the animal feed industry and in the food industry as a gelling agent.  Phytopathogenic and saprophytic bacteria and fungi can produce variety of extracellular and intracellular enzymes that degrade pectin and its derivatives.  Pectinolytic enzymes such as esterases, hydrolases and lyases, are used in the food, fiber and animal feed industries.  There is commercial interest in pectinolytic enzymes to convert the pectin-rich by-products from citrus peel and sugar beet processing to higher value material.

They are found in all eukaryotes including unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals.


MAP kinases are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis |CITS: [11294822]|.



MAP kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to be active, they need to be phosphorylated. Most of the MAP kinases belong to the "classical MAP kinases" family and need to be phosphorylated on two amino acids, a threonine and a tyrosine, which are found in a TxY motif at the activation loop. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine precedes phosphorylation of the threonine. Some MAP kinases are atypical and require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated.



|FRAME: EC-2.7.12.2 "EC 2.7.12.2"|, |FRAME: MAP-kinase-MEK "Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase"| (also known as MAP2K, MEK, MAPKK) is the enzyme that phosphorylates MAP kinases. In humans there are seven genes encoding MAP2K enzymes. MAP2K enzymes also need to be activated by phosphorylation prior to becoming active. The activation is carried out by the serine/threonine protein kinase |FRAME: EC-2.7.11.25 "EC 2.7.11.25"|,  MAP kinase kinase kinase ( MAP3K or MEKK).

In type II AGs, known also as arabino-3,6-galactan, the (&beta;-1&rarr;3)-D-Galp backbone is heavily substituted at position 6 by mono- and oligosaccharide side chains composed of arabinosyl and galactosyl units. It is more widespread than the AG type I and occurs in cell walls of dicots and cereals often linked to proteins (known as arabinogalactan proteins). AG type II, along with galactomannans and cellulose, comprises the predominating polysaccharides of green arabica coffee beans |CITS: [11217967]|. In some case type II AG contains a small amount of &beta;-glucuronate.



There are many variations of AG type II produced by different plants. Two forms that have been studied thoroughly are |FRAME: Gum-Arabic "gum arabic AG"|, which is produced by acacia trees, and |FRAME: Larch-AG "larch AG|, produced by larch trees (members of the genus |FRAME: TAX-3325|).

Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesins, and toxins are lipoproteins, including the high-density (HDL) and low-density (LDL) lipoproteins that carry fats in the blood stream.
The lipoprotein known as |FRAME: EG10544-MONOMER| (Lpp) is considered the most abundant protein in |FRAME: TAX-562| and accounts for more than 40% of the peptidoglycan on a weight basis. It is necessary for the stabilization and integrity of the bacterial cell envelope and is thought to physically tether the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan layer |CITS:[4899922][4565677][4578317]|.



Membrane-attached lipoproteins of Gram-negative bacteria and Mycobacteria are tethered to the membrane by an N-acyl-(S-diacylglyceryl)-cysteine anchor that is variably acylated depending on the genus. In many Gram-positive bacteria certain variations exist (see below).



In bacteria all lipoproteins are initially translated as precursors (|FRAME: Prolipoproteins prolipoproteins|) containing an N-terminal signal peptide that contains a conserved lipobox motif sequence preceding a cysteine residue |CITS: [12876315][19367716]|. Once transported to the outer face of the membrane, |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.145| (Lgt) attaches a diacylglycerol moiety from a phospholipid donor by a thioether bond to the cysteine residue |CITS: [8051048]|.

In most organisms |FRAME: EC-3.4.23.36| (Lsp) then cleaves the leader peptide leaving the cysteine as the N-terminal amino acid of the protein |CITS: [7040395]|. However, it has been found that in |FRAME: TAX-2115| the peptide is cleaved two amino acids away from the cysteine (towards the N-terminus) |CITS: [22303020]|.

In Gram-negative bacteria biosynthesis is completed by |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.269| (Lnt), which transfers a fatty acid from a membrane phospholipid to form an amide linkage with the N-terminus of the cysteine residue, generating a triacylated molecule |CITS: [2032623]|.



More variety is found in some low GC Gram-positive bacteria. Three new forms have been observed - a |FRAME: Peptidyl-Form-Lipoprotein-N-terminus "peptidyl form"| (which results from the alternative cleaving by Lsp, with two amino acids present before the lipid-modified cysteine residue, which is described above), an |FRAME: N-Acetyl-Lipoprotein "N-acetyl form"|, and an N-acylated monoacyl-glyceryl form known as the |FRAME: Lyso-Form-Lipoprotein-Cysteine "lyso-form"| |CITS: [22135097][22303020][28320885]|.

by inducing a change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site or interferes in some other way with the translation initiation

pathway.  Alternatively, the protein can process the transcript in some way to cause or prevent its targeting for degradation.  A third option is that by 

translational attenuation, the protein can interact with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records the 

specific regulation mechanism, if known.



In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose 

translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be a gene).  The regulator will be a protein.

Members of this family are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive activator (component A) and a dehydratase (component D). Component A is a homodimer with one [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster bound in the dimer interface, while component D is a heterodimer with 1-2 [4Fe&ndash;4S] clusters and FMN. In order to catalyze the reaction, the dehydratase requires one high-energy electron that transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion, facilitating the elimination of the hydroxyl group. The electron needs to be supplied only once, before the first reaction takes place, since it is regenerated at the end of each reaction cycle. This initial activation is provided by the activator. 



The activator, which has been named |FRAME: CPLX-9331 archerase| because its open position resembles an archer shooting arrows, binds two ADP molecules. Upon the reduction of its [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster by a single electron, delivered by a dedicated flavodoxin, the two ADP molecules exchange for two ATP molecules, resulting in a large conformational change. The change results in the activator binding to the dehydratase component, upon which the two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed and the electron is transferred to the dehydratase, activating it |CITS: [15374661][18337824]|.



The structure shown here depicts the reduced [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster.

General Background 



Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible interconversion of protons, electrons and  |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE|, resulting in |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE| oxidation to two protons or in the reverse direction, molecular hydrogen production by the reduction of protons.



Most hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that contain iron-sulfur clusters. They have been subdivided into two main classes based on the composition of two metal atoms at their active center: [NiFe] hydrogenases and [FeFe] hydrogenases. These two classes are phylogenetically distinct. It should be noted that in some of the [NiFe] hydrogenases one of the Ni-bound cysteine residues is replaced by selenocysteine. Those enzymes are known as [NiFeSe] hydrogenases. The [FeFe] hydrogenases usually have high catalytic activity, but are sensitive to irreversible inactivation by |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE|, more so than [NiFe] hydrogenases. 



While [FeFe] hydrogenases are limited to certain bacteria and a few unicellular eukaryotes, [NiFe] hydrogenases are widespread in both bacteria and archaea |CITS: [20463892]|. 



 [NiFe] hydrogenases are usually heterodimeric proteins, but can be associated with additional subunits.The large subunit contains the [NiFe] catalytic site, while the smaller subunit contains 3 FeS clusters.  These clusters transfer electrons from an external electron donor to the [NiFe] site for reduction of protons |CITS: [20463892]|.

Many [FeFe]-hydrogenases are monomeric but possess additional domains that contain FeS clusters |CITS: [18500479]|. The catalytic core of [FeFe] hydrogenases is a single domain of about 350 residues that accommodates the active site known as the H cluster.



In addition, a third class of hydrogenases is found in some methanogenic archaea. These enzymes contain only a mononuclear Fe active site and no FeS clusters, and are known as [Fe] hydrogenases.

    rdfs:comment """Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"|) that serves a role similar to ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12| |CITS: [11687213]|


Unlike ferredoxin, flavodoxins contain a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"| (FMN) cofactor. They exist in three redox states: in an |FRAME: Oxidized-flavodoxins "oxidized form"|, as a |FRAME: Flavodoxins-Semiquinones semiquinone|, or as the fully-reduced |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins hydroquinone|. The complexion of the cofactor FMN involves two distinct mechanisms in flavodoxins. The phosphoribityl part of the molecule is bound by hydrogen bonds, while the isoalloxazine ring is kept in place mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The phosphate group is bound by a loop that contains the key fingerprint motif for flavodoxins, T/S-X-T-G-X-T |CITS: [10610791]|. 



Flavodoxins can be divided into two structural classes: short-chain flavodoxins with ~150 residues and long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ~20 amino-acid residues interrupting the final strand of &beta;-sheet.



Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+

reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.



Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. In many organisms, including cyanobacteria and anaerobes, Fld can substitute for Fd under conditions of iron deprivation.



Please note that due to the limited ability to show protein structures, the structure shown here depicts only the FMN cofactor of flavodoxin.

bc:Regulation rdfs:comment """This class describes most forms of protein, RNA or activity regulation.  Regulation can be either by a direct influence on the protein's activity
(e.g. allosteric inhibition of an enzyme) or by influencing the quantity of active protein available (e.g. by inducing or blocking its transcription 

or translation).  The one form of regulation that is not covered by this class is when the quantity of a protein is regulated as a result of chemical 

or binding reactions that either produce or consume the active form of a protein -- these are represented as Reactions instead.  There can be

some ambiguity as to what should be represented as a reaction and what should be represented as a regulation event.  In general, an event that

can be represented as a reaction should be when a) there is sufficiently detailed information known to model it as a reaction, b) both reactants

and products exist as stable, independent entities, and c) our schema supports referring to both reactant and product of the reaction independently 

and there is some justification for wanting to go down to that level of detail.  For example, a transcription factor bound to a small molecule will 

generally have a different activity than the unbound transcription factor.  This could be represented either as the reaction TF + x -> TF-x or as 

a regulation event in which x activates or inhibits the activity of TF.  However, because both TF and TF-x are stable molecules which can 

potentially regulate different transcription units (not all will, but some do), or TF could bind another small molecule y and regulate yet another set 

of transcription units, we prefer to model this kind of interaction as a reaction when the data is available.  On the other hand, an enzyme binding to 

some inhibitor could also be represented as a reaction, but since there is rarely any reason to refer to the enzyme-inhibitor complex outside of

the context of the reaction the enzyme catalyzes, we choose instead to model these events as regulation events in which the inhibitor regulates the

activity of the enzyme.



Instances of this class represent a one-to-one mapping between regulator and regulated-entity (i.e. an entity may regulate many processes,  or a

process may be regulated by many entities, but each one requires its own instance of Regulation to represent it)

bc:Regulation-of-Enzyme-Activity rdfs:comment """Instances of this class describe substrate-level modulation of enzyme activity.  The
situation where a small molecule competitively inhibits an enzyme activity would

be represented as follows:

Regulator            = The small molecule

Regulated-Entity = The enzymatic reaction for that enzyme activity

Mechanism          = Competitive

Mode                  = +



Possible mechanisms and their definitions are as follows:

Allosteric          -- Allosteric regulators increase or decrease the enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that alters the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX.

Competitive       -- Competitive inhibitors bind reversibly to the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding.  Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme.

Noncompetitive  -- Noncompetitive inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or to the enzyme-substrate complex.  The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other.  However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.

Uncompetitive    -- Uncompetitive inhibitors inhibit the enzyme by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex, but not to the enzyme alone.

Mixed               -- Mixed inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex, and decrease the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.

Irreversible        -- Irreversible inhibitors bind to the enzyme and dissociate so slowly that it is considered irreversible.  For example, alkylating agents such as iodoacetamide irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.

Other                -- Regulators that regulate the enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized but cannot be clearly classified as one of the above mechanisms.



If no mechanism is specified, then the mechanism is unknown, either because the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or because a full literature search has yet to be performed.

Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.

    rdfs:comment """Natural rubber is an important raw material in an enormous number of products. The backbone of natural rubber comprises a (cis)-1,4-polyisoprene with two or three trans-isoprene units at the &omega;-terminus, formed by the sequential condensation of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (IPP) units in cis configuration onto a short all-trans prenyl diphosphate. It is very similar in structure to |FRAME: DOLICHOL dolichols|, but the chain length is much longer (C>1500).


Natural rubber is produced from latex - a material that makes up the cytoplasmic content of the latecifers or latex vessels of |FRAME: TAX-3981| (the Brazilian rubber tree) |CITS: [17545224]|. Although over 2000 plant species capable of producing rubber have been identified, only a few synthesize the high molecular weight rubber that is required for the production of high quality rubber products, and natural rubber is currently produced commercially only from |FRAME: TAX-3981|. A potential alternative source is the Russian rubber-producing dandelion (|FRAME: TAX-333970|), which was cultivated in the former Soviet Union during World War II to satisfy the demand for natural rubber |CITS: [22504822]|.



Rubber biosynthesis is carried out by |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.20|. The enzyme is localized at the surface of cytosolic vesicles known as rubber particles, and biosynthesis is initiated through the binding of an allylic pyrophosphate primer, such as |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| |CITS: [Tanaka01][14622254][18799172]|.



The R in the structure stands for an unspecified number of (cis)-connected isoprene units.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

The first strigolactone (|FRAME: CPD-14655|) was described from |FRAME: TAX-3635| (cotton) infected by the root parasitic weeds |FRAME: TAX-4169| (witchweed) (hence the name). It has been shown that the seeds of the parasites germinated only if they were exposed to stimulant molecules present in the root exudate of the host. Although the nature of strigol was not understood at the time, it was observed that it was active at hormonal levels |CITS: [17780042]|.



Discovery of additional strigolactones from other plants followed, such as |FRAME: CPD-14659| from |FRAME: TAX-4558| |CITS: [Hauck92]|, |FRAME: CPD-14660| from |FRAME: TAX-3917| |CITS: [Mueler92]| and |FRAME: CPD-14657| from |FRAME: TAX-57577| (red clover) |CITS: [Yokota98]|.



The real purpose of strigolactones, which was understood 40 years after the discovery of strigol, is to promote the formation of symbiotic associations known as arbuscular mycorrhiza, which consist of close interaction between the plants roots and |FRAME: TAX-214504| fungi |CITS: [15944706][16574693]|. Arbuscular mycorrhiza, which are found in more than 80% of higher plant species, are one of the most ancient symbioses of land plants. The fungi acquire and deliver nutrients to the plants, which in return provides the fungi with carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis |CITS: [15944687]|.



The lactones induce extensive hyphal branching in germinating spores of the fungi, which increases the chance of contact with the root and subsequently infecting it. The branching phenomenon has been known for more than 30 years before the identity of the chemical signal that promotes it has been traced to strigolactone |CITS: [Mosse73]|.



Since strigolactones are very labile and active at concentrations as low as picomolar, they are active only in close proximity to potential host roots, ensuring successful interactionbetween the fungi the roots.



Study of mutants lacking strigolactones suggest that the hormones are also involved in the regulation of shoot branching, acting as branch-inhibiting hormones |CITS: [15268852][15342640]|.

The protein contains several domains, and different domains are involved in tRNA modification and thiazole formation.

In vitro studies using radiolabelled sulfur showed transfer of sulfur from IscS to ThiI; if tRNA is included, the sulfur appears to be incorporated into the tRNA in a ThiI- and ATP-dependent manner.  Based on these results, a model for mobilization and transfer of sulfur from cysteine via IscS and ThiI to U8 of tRNA has been presented |CITS: [10753862]|.

The protein contains several domains, and different domains are involved in tRNA modification and thiazole formation.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

During this reaction the enzyme catalyzes a transsulfuration of |FRAME: 3-MERCAPTO-PYRUVATE| |CITS: [16107337]|, forming |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and an enzyme-bound persulfide, which can be released as H2S in the presence of reducing systems like GSH or thioredoxin |CITS: [21732914]|.



In addition to that function, the enzyme was reported to mediate the transfer of sulfur from the NFS1 L-cysteine desulfurase to other sulfurtransferase (Uba4p in yeast and MOCS3 in humans), as part of a sulfur relay chain that is responsible for the 2-thiolation of certain tRNAs in the cytosol |CITS: [19151091]|.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

    rdfs:comment """Teichoic acids were first reported in 1958 |CITS: [Armstrong58]|, after being discovered serendipitously as "contaminants" in bacterial extracts from |FRAME: TAX-1590| |CITS: [2662967]|. As they make up a significant portion of the cell walls (about 60% in |FRAME: TAX-1423|) |CITS: [13684313]|, they were named based on the Greek word teikhos, which means a fortification wall.


The teichoic acids are found in the cell walls of a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. There are two main types of teichoic acids: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall.



In |FRAME: TAX-224308| the main form of teichoic acid is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-75 "poly(glycerol phosphate)"|, while in |FRAME: TAX-655816| the major variety is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-19310 "poly(ribitol phosphate)"| |CITS: [13684313]|. In both cases, the repeating units are joined together by phosphodiester linkages, and are anchored via 2-3 glycerol phosphate units to a N-acetyl-&beta;-D-mannosaminyl-(1&rarr;4)-N-acetyl-&alpha;-D-glucosamine disaccharide. The glycerol and ribitol units of the polysaccharides are modified with D-alanine esters and/or monosaccharides such as glucose or N-acetylglucosamine |CITS: [13684313][4321415]|.



It should be noted that strain 168 also possesses a |FRAME: CPD-19345 "minor form of wall teichoic acid"| that is comprised of poly(glucosyl N-acetylgalactosamine 1-phosphate) |CITS: [4202940]|). 



Teichoic acids serve several roles in the cell. They serve as reservoirs of phosphates which can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg2+), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides |CITS: [46620]|.

be omitted if the transcription start site is unknown, in which case the correspondence

is between a transcription unit and a set of genes.  Multiple terminators can be included 

in a transcription-unit, but typically a separate transcription unit is defined for each

generally no transcription unit is defined for the truncated transcript produced by

attenuation, even if it includes the gene for a leader peptide).

    rdfs:comment """The teichoic acids are found in a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. They include a diverse family of cell surface glycopolymers containing up to 60 phosphodiester-linked repeat units. There are two main types: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall. Five types of lipoteichoic acids |CITS: [24819367]| and four types of wall teichoic acids |CITS: [24024634]| have been described so far.


LTAs have been grouped into different types (type I through V) based on their chemical structures. Type I LTA is found in a large range of Firmicutes. It has an unbranched 1�3 linked glycerol phosphate (GroP) backbone, and is usually linked to the bacterial membrane via a glycolipid anchor. The hydroxyl groups at the C-2 position of the GroP repeating units are modified with D-alanyl or glycosyl groups to varying degrees. It should be noted that not all type I LTAs are glycosylated, and variations in the type of sugar exist. For example, some |FRAME: TAX-1386 Bacillus| strains lack glycosyl groups, some contain |FRAME: CPD-12541|, and some contain |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| |CITS: [3733670][2914853]|. The LTA of all |FRAME: TAX-1639| strains investigated to date is glycosylated with |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| |CITS: [6415040][3093460]|, and the LTA of |FRAME: TAX-1280| strain H is glycosylated with |FRAME: CPD-12541| |CITS: [6268617]|.



LTAs can be very abundant. In |FRAME: TAX-1280| every ninth lipid on the outer leaflet of the membrane is an LTA molecule, and the average length is 25 GroP units |CITS: [6697992]|. Although the exact role of LTA is unknown, mutants display significant growth and physiological defects. Teichoic acids are proposed to serve as reservoirs of phosphates that can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg2+), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides |CITS: [46620]|.

bc:Type-II-Peroxiredoxins rdfs:label "a type II peroxiredoxin" ;
    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: Peroxiredoxins Peroxiredoxins| are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes that have been identified in eubacteria, archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|. All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine (the peroxidative cysteine or Cp) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity. Substrates for peroxiredoxins include |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE "hydrogen peroxides"|, |FRAME: Alkyl-Hydro-Peroxides "alkyl hydroperoxides"|, and |FRAME: CPD0-1395 peroxynitrites|.


Depending on the specific peroxiredoxin enzyme, reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE|, |FRAME: Thioredoxin thioredoxin|, |FRAME: Glutaredoxins glutaredoxin|, cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.



The first peroxiredoxin was identified in |FRAME: TAX-4932| in 1987 and named thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA), because it was thought to remove reactive sulfur species rather than reactive oxygen species |CITS: [2895105]|. The correct functional assignment was made after the discovery of AhpC (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase) in |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [2191951]|.



All peroxiredoxins contain an L-cysteine residue that attacks the substrate (Cp) and becomes hydroxylated during the catalytic cycle. Multiple classification systems have been suggested for the peroxiredoxins, based on the mechanism for the reduction of the hydroxylated Cp residue and on sequence analysis.



According to an earlier classification system, the enzymes were categorized into three classes based on the location or absence of a second L-cysteine residue (CR) that is involved in restoring Cp to its reduced state. The three classes are:



1. |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins "2-Cys-peroxiredoxins"| (also called typical 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins) are homodimeric and contain two conserved (Cp and CR) cysteine residues per subunit. The Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the CR of the other subunit to form an intersubunit disulfide.



2. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins "Type II peroxiredoxins"|, (also called atypical 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins), are monomeric, and the Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the CR of the same subunit, forming an intrasubunit disulfide. Members of this class can use thioredoxin and/or glutaredoxin as the reductant |CITS: [12913160]|. A subtype is the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins "Q-type peroxiredoxins"|, which are homologs of the |FRAME: EG10108| (bacterioferritin co-migrating protein) of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [10998352]|.



3. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins "1-Cys-peroxiredoxins"| contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine |CITS: [8914536]|. Given the absence of a CR, Cp&ndash;SOH of 1-Cys enzymes cannot be resolved within the peroxiredoxin molecules and instead forms a disulfide with a cysteine residue provided by other proteins or small thiol molecules |CITS: [20919932]|.



In later publications the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins "Q-type peroxiredoxins"| are considered a separate 4th class |CITS: [15890615][18493039]|.



According to the second classification system, which was introduced in 2011 based on sequence analysis of more than 3500 enzymes, the enzymes are divided into six classes -  AhpC-Prx1 (identical to the typical 2-Cys class), BCP-PrxQ (named after the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: EG10108| and plant |FRAME: AT3G26060|), Tpx (named for the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: G6660|), Prx5 (named for the mammalian |FRAME: HS05016-MONOMER|), Prx6 (named for the mammalian |FRAME: CPLX-9416|, sometimes referred to as the 1-Cys group), and AhpE (named for |FRAME: TAX-1773| AhpE) |CITS: [21287625]|.



Mammalian cells express six peroxiredoxins - PrxI to PrxIV are 2-Cys, PrxV is an atypical 2-Cys, and PrxVI is 1-Cys |CITS: [11795591]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| expresses five peroxiredoxins -  Tsa1 and Tsa2 are two 2-Cys, Ahp1 and nTpx are atypical 2-Cys, and mTpx is 1-Cys |CITS: [26813659]|. The plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| expresses nine peroxiredoxins.

Like ubiquitin, the C-terminus of the protein ends with two glycine residues, and can be adenylated and sulfurated by the |FRAME: HS04742| sulfurtransferase. Sulfuration forms a C-terminal thiocarboxylate group, which serves as the sulfur donor for the tRNAs |CITS: [19017811][19145231]|.


URM1 also acts as a ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) and is covalently conjugated via an isopeptide bond to lysine residues of certain target proteins in a process that is called urmylation. Documented target proteins include |FRAME: HS04742|, |FRAME: HS06936|, |FRAME: G-55129|, USP15, CAS, and peroxiredoxin Ahp1 |CITS: [21209336]|.

The mechanism by which the thiocarboxylated URM1 protein is transferred to its target protein is not known yet.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.

Five types of precursor disaccharides are known to carry ABH activity - type 1 through type 4 and type 6.

Type 1 precursors are widely expressed on endodermally-derived tissues such as lining epithelia and glandular epithelia. Type 2 precursors are found mainly on ecto- or mesodermally-derived tissues, including erythrocytes |CITS: [Mollicone86]|. Type 3 and 4 precursors are found on ecto- or endodermally-derived tissues, including the salivary glands and kidneys |CITS: [2464874]|.



Since ABH antigens are present not only on erythrocytes, but also on various organs such as the salivary glands and kidneys |CITS: [3965299][6172274]|, they are called histo-blood group ABH antigens.

CRISPR sequences are found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea |CITS: [29522745]|.


CRISPR sequences are utilized by CRISPR-associated systems (Cas). A complex of Cas proteins (called Cascade) cuts the |FRAME: Pre-crRNAs "CRISPR RNA precursor"| within the repeats into mature RNA molecules called |FRAME: crRNAs CRISPR RNA"| (crRNA), which remains bound to the Cascade complex. Other Cas proteins are DNA or RNA nucleases. The complex guides tthose enzymes to its target (bacteriophage necleic acid), which is then cleaved |CITS: [22745249]|.



By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, an artificial Cas9 system can be programmed to target any DNA sequence for cleavage, making CRISPR a powerful tool for in vivo genetic engineering |CITS: [24136345][27401123]|.



Some Cas systems, such as Cas-9, require an additional small RNA, known as trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) for activity |CITS: [21455174]|.

    rdfs:comment """tRNA(sec) is a special tRNA that inserts selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons.


tRNAs are the adapters that allow synthesis of proteins from mRNAs. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome for protein synthesis. There, the tRNA recognizes an RNA codon with its own three-nucleotide anticodon, thus allowing synthesis of a specific peptide based on an mRNA template.



tRNA(sec) can insert selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons |CITS: [3033637]|. The ability of tRNA(sec) to insert selenocysteine appears to depend on the specific sequence and folding of a stem-loop 3' to the insertion site |CITS: [1834670][1396569]|. tRNA(sec) has poor affinity for the normal elongation factor EF-Tu, instead binding to the specialized |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| |CITS: [2408012][2531290]|. The aminoacyl acceptor helix of tRNA(sec) promotes binding to |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| and prevents binding to EF-Tu |CITS: [1939093][2524495]|. 



Mature tRNAs are linked via a 3' CCA sequence to their cognate amino acid in an ATP-dependent fashion by the appropriate amino-acid-tRNA synthetase, as shown in the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|. tRNA(sec) is charged in a two-step process, being aminoacylated with L-serine by |FRAME: SERS-CPLX|, then having that associated amino acid converted to selenocysteine by |FRAME: CPLX0-1141|, as shown in |FRAME: PWY0-901| |CITS: [2963963][1839607]|. Subsequently, these charged tRNAs interact with the ribosome and template mRNA to generate polypeptides. The discovery of the role of tRNA in protein synthesis is reviewed in detail in |CITS: [7033244]|.



tRNA(sec) varies in areas that are otherwise invariant across most tRNAs |CITS: [2963963][2529478]|. Many of these differences act to prevent incorrect addition of selenocysteine at random UGA stop codons |CITS: [1370545]|. tRNA(sec) has an unusual acceptor stem consisting of eight, rather than seven base pairs, which is required for proper function |CITS: [1702199]|. 



The solution structure of tRNA(sec) has been chemically evaluated |CITS: [8510147]|.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of several cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.


During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H2PteGlu1. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H4PteGlu1, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.



Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.



The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.



The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.



This class stands for 5-methyltetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.

The cytokinins are structurally diverse, and have been divided into two main types: |FRAME: Adenine-Cytokinins "adenine-type cytokinins"| and |FRAME: Phenylurea-Cytokinins "phenylurea-type cytokinins"|. All the natural cytokinins fall into the first type - phenylurea-type cytokinins are synthetic.



The adenine cytokinins are classified further by the configuration of their N6-side chain as isoprenoid or aromatic cytokinins. The most prevalent cytokinins are by far those with an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain, and in particular those with a trans-hydroxylated N6-side chain, such as |FRAME: CPD-4210| and its derivatives.



Most of the adenine-type cytokinins are modified by glucosylation of the adenine ring at the 3-, the 7-, or 9-position and conjugation of alanine at the 9-position of zeatin, forming lupinic acid. With the exception of the 3-glucosides, the N-glucosyl and alanyl conjugates generally exhibit no or low activity.



The most important modifications are those affecting the N6-side chain, where even small substitutions have pronounced effects on cytokinin activity. The most common modifications of the side chain include reduction (e.g. trans-zeatin to dihydrozeatin), conjugation to O-glycosides (O-glucosides and O-xylosides), and side chain cleavage by cytokinin oxidases |CITS: [11337393]|.

The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K1 (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K2 (|FRAME: Menaquinones|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts, there are many variations of vitamin K2, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K2(45).

Menaquinones are synthesized by gut bacteria, and are absorbed into the blood. Thus, dietary deficiency is extremely rare in healthy individuals.



There are also several synthetic forms-   vitamin K3 through K9. Vitamin K3 (|FRAME: CPD-3766|) is the most active of the synthetic forms.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: CPD0-1099 "Colanic acid"| is an exopolysaccharide secreted by |FRAME: TAX-562| and a number of other |FRAME: TAX-543| that encapsulates the organism, resulting in a mucoid appearance |CITS: [13963285]|. Colanic acid is thought to promote biofilm formation and to protect the organism when exposed to harsh environments such as acidic conditions |CITS:  [11371548][16706906]|.


Even though it wasn't identified as such, colanic acid was first described in 1927 by Dorothea Smith, who isolated a polysaccharide from a mucoid strain of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [19869322]|. Fourteen years later, in a study on the antigens of the Enterobacteriaceae, it was noticed that one antigen was common to several mucoid strains of |FRAME: TAX-57045| |CITS: [Kauffmann41]|. It was soon reported that the same antigen, which was named "M" antigen, is produced by mucoid Escherichia coli strains |CITS: [15406247]|. In 1954 Kauffmann reported that the antigen was common to all mucoid Salmonella species |CITS: [Kauffmann54]|.



Similar exopolysaccharides were reported from a number of mucoid strains and species |CITS: [13475241][13641209][13963285][14073028][5324934]|. In the early 60s it was reported that a large number of Salmonella and Escherichia strains that are not normally mucoid can be induced to form slime exopolysaccharides when grown at 15 to 20&deg;C in high phosphate concentration |CITS: [Anderson61][Anderson63]|, and the exopolysaccharide was named "colanic acid" after |FRAME: TAX-562| from which it was isolated |CITS: [13963285]|. In a paper describing the discovery of the same polysaccharide in |FRAME: TAX-83333| it was suggested that colanic acid and the "M antigen" reported in the earlier studies are identical |CITS: [14206589]|. A confirmation was obtained in 1969 when it was shown that colanic acid of identical composition is produced by strains from the genera Salmonella, Escherichia, and Aerobacter. At that time the exact structure was not known, though it was known that the polysaccharide contains glucose, galactose, fucose, and glucuronate, as well as some O-acetyl groups |CITS: [ 4902806]|.



Additional structural studies have shown that colanic acid from different organisms is very similar, with the polysaccharide composed of a hexasaccharide repeating unit consisting of glucose, two fucoses, two galactoses, and glucuronate. In addition, one fucose and one galactose may be acetylated to varying degrees, and the terminal galactose residue is modified. The repeat units are connected by a linkage between the first and third residues, with the remaining three residues forming a side chain |CITS: [4311825][4902692]|. Differences are found in the modifications of the terminal galactose residue, which was found to contain a 4,6-pyruvoyl group, a 3,4-pyruvoyl group, a 3,4-ethylidene group, or a 4,6-methylene group in different strains |CITS: [4941627]|. The structure shown here was published in 2007, correcting several errors in earlier reports |CITS: [17227761]|. While colanic acid was considered exclusively an exopolysaccharide that is only loosely associated with the cell surface, the 2007 study also found that colanic acid can be attached to the lipid A core of lipopolysaccharide instead of the O antigen, forming a novel type of lipopolysaccharide which was named |FRAME: 

CPD0-1101 MLPS| |CITS: [17227761]|.

However, in such a chitosan, unlike the naturally occurring chitosan, the acetyl groups are uniformly distributed along the polymer chain.



Completely de-acetylated forms of chitosan do not exist naturally, but can be synthesized by special chemical treatment.

hybrid properties: internally, they are constructed like pathways, and

be linked to its sub-reactions -- cases when we might not want to link

the enzyme to sub-reactions might be if one or more sub-reactions are

spontaneous (so the enzyme would only be linked to the non-spontaneous

be mutated to see an informative phenotype, use the IGI code. (Yes, 

this implies some organisms, such as mouse, will have far, far more IGI

than IMP annotations.)<p>



IMP also covers phenotypic similarity: a phenotype that is informative

because it is similar to that of another independent phenotype (which

may have been described earlier or documented more fully) is IMP (not IGI).<p>



We have also decided to use this category for situations where a

mutation in one gene (gene A) provides information about the function,

process, or component of another gene (gene B; i.e. annotate gene B

using IGI).

However, GAX-type polymers consist of |FRAME: Arabinoxylan| backbone that contains about ten times more &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose side chains than glucuronate ones, while AGX-type polymers are |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans| with a small proportion of the xylopyranose residues of the backbone disubstituted by two &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose residues |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.



Another difference is that GAX contain some xylopyranose units that are doubly substituted by both 4-O-methylglucuronate and &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|. Unlike glucuronoxylans, glucuronoarabinoxylans are not acetylated |CITS: [15944805]|.

GAX-type polymers are typically located in the non-endospermic tissues of cereal grains such as in wheat, corn, and rice bran |CITS: [8401598]|. GAX fractions that were isolated from wheat bran were feruloylated |CITS: [Schooneveld-Bergmans99]|.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

Kanamycins interact with the 30S subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome, inducing substantial amounts of mistranslation and indirectly inhibiting translocation during protein synthesis, resulting in death |CITS: [391568][9662506]|.

The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.



The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.



The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.



This class stands for 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.

next paragraph discusses what is common to both types of PGDBs.

Subsequent paragraphs describe the differences.



In all PGDBs, subclasses of Organisms define biological taxa, at all

possible taxonomic levels.  Class-subclass relationships between

subclasses of Organisms describe their taxonomic relationships,

since, for example, the class Bacteria includes as a subclass the

class Alphaproteobacteria.  Generally, most of the taxonomic

groups under Organisms correspond to entries from the NCBI Taxonomy 

database (which is stored in its entirety in a separate Ocelot KB).  But in

addition to taxa from NCBI Taxonomy, a PGDB can contain subclasses 

for additional taxa that are not present in the NCBI Taxonomy. 



Organism-specific PGDBs:  In an organism-specific PGDB, the only

frames that exist as children of Organisms are those frames needed to

describe the taxonomic lineage of the organism described by the PGDB.

An organism-specific PGDB contains a single instance frame that

describes information about the PGDB itself.  A parent class P of that 

instance must exist to describe the lowest taxonomic group defined for the

organism.  Additional parent classes exist as parents of P and

children of Organisms that describe the other known taxonomic

parents of P.  No other children of Organisms exist in the PGDB.



Multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc:  Multiorganism PGDBs contain

no instances of class Organisms, but only subclasses of this class.  Those 

subclasses define each of the different organisms for which MetaCyc

(for example) defines pathways and enzymes.  For economy of storage, 

only those taxa (and their parent taxa) actually referenced in the PGDB are

stored in the PGDB, so that only a subset of the NCBI Taxonomy is 

replicated in the PGDB. There is only one instance of  

Multi-Organism-Groupings that describes the properties of the PGDB.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: Pectin "Pectin"| is a structural heteropolysaccharide consisting of a complex set of polysaccharides that is present in most primary cell walls and is particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants. It s involved in crosslinking cellulose and hemicellulose fibers, which provides rigidity to the cell wall.
The characteristic structure of pectin is a linear chain of &alpha;-(1-4)-linked |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| that forms the pectin-backbone, |FRAME: 1-4-alpha-D-galacturonosyl|.



Different components of pectin have different substitutions and additions. A common type is |FRAME: Rhamnogalacturonans-I "rhamnogalacturonan I"| (RG-I), which makes up 20-35% of pectin. In RG-I some of the |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| units in the backbone are replaced by (1-2)-linked |FRAME: L-rhamnose|, to which side chains of various neutral sugars branch off, mostly |FRAME: D-Galactose|, |FRAME: L-ARABINOSE| and |FRAME: CPD-25028|. Another common type is |FRAME: CPD-14581 "rhamnogalacturonan II"| (RG-II), which makes up about 10% of pectin. RG-II is based on a backbone of 8-9 galacturonate units, which are decorated by four side chains consisting of 12 different types of sugars in more than 20 different linkages. RG-II usually forms dimeric structures via the formation of crosslinks by a 1:2 borate diol ester between apiosyl residues in one of the side chains.



Other types of pectin include chains of apiogalacturonan, homogalacturonan, and xylogalacturonan. There is currently no consensus as to how the pectic polysaccharides are linked to each other, or to other polymers, in the wall. However, it is thought that the different peptides are covalently linked to each other via their backbones, forming a large linear structure with many side branches |CITS: [11423143][12162553][Coenen07]|.



In nature, around 80% of the carboxyl groups of the galacturonate units are esterified with |FRAME: METOH|. Some plants, including sugar beet, potatoes and pears, contain pectins with acetylated galacturonate in addition to methyl esters. 



Partially esterified pectins are often referred to as pectinate, and if the degree of esterification is below 5%, |FRAME: PECTATE|.

    rdfs:comment """Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are a family of multi-domain enzymes or enzyme complexes that produce polyketides, a large class of secondary metabolites produced in bacteria, fungi, plants, and a few animal lineages.


Polyketide synthases are classified into three groups:



1. Type I polyketide synthases are very large, highly modular, homodimeric proteins. They comprise multiple modules, each consisting of several domains separated by short spacer regions and fulfilling different catalytic steps. The minimal composition of a type I PKS module includes an acyltransferase (AT) domain, a keto synthase (KS) domain, and an acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain. An exception are the trans-AT PKSs, which lack AT domains and rely on free-standing AT domains to provide this functionality. Dimerization is essential for the function of multimodular polyketide synthases, though only the KS domains require dimerization for their activity |CITS: [23489133]|.



2. Type II polyketide synthases are complexes of monofunctional proteins.  The smallest possible type II PKS complex consists of three proteins - an ACP, a ketosynthase (KS&alpha;) and a ketosynthase chain length factor (KSCLF, CLF, or KS&beta;). The combined action of these units fulfills a similar function as the AT, KS and ACP domains in type I PKSs |CITS: [17268612]|.



3. Type III polyketide synthases are small homodimers that do not use acyl-carrier protein (ACP) domains. Instead they use a free acyl-CoA substrate for chain elongation |CITS: [27862822]|.



Typical domains of type I PKSs include: acyltransferase (AT), acyl carrier protein (ACP), keto-synthase (KS), ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), enoylreductase (ER), methyltransferase (MT), PLP-dependent cysteine lyase (SH), and thioesterase (TE). Other, less common domains, are also found.



A typical reaction of a PKS starts with the binding of a starter unit (usually acetyl-CoA, although many other starter unitts are known). The nascent polyketide chain is handed over from the ACP domain of one module to the KS domain of the next module, in a reaction catalyzed by the KS domain. An extender group, usually malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA, is loaded onto the current ACP domain by the current AT domain. The extender group then reacts in a Claisen condensation with the KS-bound nascent polyketide chain, at the KS-bound end of the chain, resulting in an elongated chain and the release of a CO2 molecule. Other domains, such as the KR, DH, MT etc can act on the product, introducing or reducing double bonds, removing hydroxyl groups, adding methyl groups, etc. The elongation cycle repeats until the the product reaxhes the TE domain, which hydrolyzes the completed polyketide chain from the PKS |CITS: [27266330]|.

Type III enzymes are found in archaea, and are capable of carbon fixation, even though these organisms do not have a CBB cycle. They are dimeric (see |FRAME:CPLX-7442| from |FRAME: TAX-311400| for an example).



Type IV enzymes are missing some crucial residues, and are not able to catalyze carbon fixation. They are also dimeric, and have been shown to participate in methionine salvage (see |FRAME: CPLX-7445| from |FRAME: TAX-1423| and |FRAME: CPLX-8607| from |FRAME: TAX-1085| for examples).

Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|.

    rdfs:comment """The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).


The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.



Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.



Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, |FRAME: Fatty-Alcohols alcohols|, and |FRAME: Fatty-Aldehydes aldehydes|, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:



|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.



Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the trans configuration, it is often referred to as a trans fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the

During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the

membrane due to three potential processes



1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active

pumping of protons across a membrane.



2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.



3. Scalar reactions that consume protons on one side of a membrane, or produce them

on the other side of the membrane, without actually moving a proton from one

compartment to another.



Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit

    rdfs:comment """tRNAAsx is a class consisting of two tRNAs - |FRAME: ASP-tRNAs|, which binds |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, and |FRAME: ASN-tRNAs|, which binds |FRAME: ASN|. The need for such a class arises from the existence of enzymes that can accept both tRNAs (see |FRAME: EC-6.1.1.23|).


|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

Iron-sulfur clusters are prosthetic groups of many proteins, which function as intracellular electron carriers

with a low reduction potential.

In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur clusters are also known to participate in

the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes

and the storage of iron and sulfur.

In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate

in gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|.



[4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters feature four iron ions and four sulfide ions placed at the vertices of a cubane-type structure.  The Fe centers are typically further coordinated by cysteinyl ligands. 



Two main types of [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters are low-potential (bacterial-type) clusters and high-potential (HiPIP) clusters. The bacterial clusters shift between the oxidation states +1 and +2, while the HiPIP clusters shift between the oxidation states +2 and +3.



In some enzymes the [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters bind substrates and are thus classified as enzyme cofactors. For example, in radical SAM enzymes the cluster binds and reduces S-adenosylmethionine, generating a radical that interacts with the enzyme's substrate. In a few cases, as in |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.8|, the cluster serves as the source of sulfur atoms for a sulfuration reaction |CITS: [29051382]|.

In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12| |CITS: [11687213]|


Unlike ferredoxin, flavodoxins contain a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"| (FMN) cofactor. They exist in three redox states: in an |FRAME: Oxidized-flavodoxins "oxidized form"|, as a |FRAME: Flavodoxins-Semiquinones semiquinone|, or as the fully-reduced |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins hydroquinone|. The complexion of the cofactor FMN involves two distinct mechanisms in flavodoxins. The phosphoribityl part of the molecule is bound by hydrogen bonds, while the isoalloxazine ring is kept in place mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The phosphate group is bound by a loop that contains the key fingerprint motif for flavodoxins, T/S-X-T-G-X-T |CITS: [10610791]|. 



Flavodoxins can be divided into two structural classes: short-chain flavodoxins with ~150 residues and long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ~20 amino-acid residues interrupting the final strand of &beta;-sheet.



Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+

reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.



Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. In many organisms, including cyanobacteria and anaerobes, Fld can substitute for Fd under conditions of iron deprivation.



Please note that due to the limited ability to show protein structures, the structure shown here depicts only the FMN cofactor of flavodoxin.

Like thioredoxins they reduce intracellular disulfides, but they are much more efficient than thioredoxins in catalyzing protein deglutathionylation by reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides |CITS:[12682041]|. The glutaredoxins seem to play a major role in oxidative stress responses and iron-sulfur cluster assembly .


Glutaredoxins have been divided into three classes - the "classical" dithiol proteins, monothiol proteins, and GST-related dithiol proteins. The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif; while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site. The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif |CITS: [17089213]|.



Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However, unlike thioredoxins glutaredoxins can utilize the thiols from GSH in solution together with the glutaredoxin N-terminal cysteine in a mechanism that is called the monothiol mechanism.



Proteins that belong to the monothiol glutaredoxins include a CGFS motif in their active-site.

The group includes such proteins as yeast GRX3, GRX4 and GRX5, and E. coli GRX4 |CITS: [11898418]|.

The need for such a class arises from the existence of enzymes that can accept both tRNAs (see |FRAME: EC-6.1.1.24|).


|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

The plant cell wall is composed of |FRAME: CELLULOSE| and many additional complex polymers.

Unlike cellulose, which is crystalline and resistant to hydrolysis, the other polymers are amorphous and are easily hydrolyzed by dilute acid or base.



Hemicellulose is a heterogeneous term that is used for all the plant cell wall components that are soluble in dilute alkali solutions, or that go into solution quite readily in hot dilute mineral acids with the formation of simple sugars. The term is often used to describe all the polysaccharide components of the cell wall other than cellulose.



Hemicelluloses constitute about one-fourth of perennial plants and about one-third of annual plants. Since the term does not refer to a particular chemical entity, hemicelluloses extracted from different plant sources are rarely identical. 

However, D-xylose is the dominant building unit of the hemicelluloses of most woods and annual plants. D-xylose occurs as the polymer |FRAME: Xylans|, as derivatives of xylan, such as |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylan| and |FRAME: Arabinoxylan arabinoxylan|, and as side chains on other types of backbones, such as |FRAME: Xyloglucan xyloglucan| and |FRAME: Xylogalacturonan xylogalacturonan|.

D-Mannose is also very abundant, and occurs as the polymer |FRAME: 1-4-Mannan mannan| or in combination with D-glucose or D-galactose as |FRAME: Glucomannans glucomannans|, |FRAME: Galactomannans galactomannan|, or |FRAME: Galactoglucomannans galactoglucomannan|. Arabinose is common as well, either in the form of |FRAME: Arabinans "L-arabinan"| or in the form of side chains on other polysaccharides.



Other sugars common in hemicellulose include |FRAME: Galactose galactose|, |FRAME: Rhamnose rhamnose|, |FRAME: Galacturonate galacturonate| and |FRAME: Mannuronate mannuronate|.



Hemicellulose consists of shorter chains than cellulose, typically 500 - 3,000 sugar units, and is usually branched.

Mammalian hemoglobins are heterotetramers with an &alpha;2&beta;2 composition, and each subunit contains a tightly bound |FRAME: Heme-b| molecule. The iron of the |FRAME: Heme-b| group is bound covalently to the globular protein via the imidazole ring of a histidine residue (known as the proximal histidine) below the porphyrin ring. A sixth position of the iron can reversibly bind oxygen by a coordinate covalent bond, but only when the iron is in the ferrous (II) state.



When oxygen is bound, it is in an "end-on bent" geometry where one oxygen atom binds the Fe atom and the other protrudes at an angle. When oxygen is not bound, a very weakly bonded water molecule fills the site, forming a distorted octahedron.



The subunit identity changes with different developmental stages and among different forms of the protein.

For example, a human cell has about 1.8 meters of DNA, but when wound around histones, it is compacted into a structure of about 90  &mu;m.


There are five major families of histones: H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, all of which are involved in the formation of a single nucleosome. Two molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (also known as the core histones) assemble to form one octameric nucleosome core particle, around which the DNA wraps in a left-handed super-helical turn. A single molecule of histone H1 (known as the linker histone) then binds to the nucleosome, locking the DNA in place.



Two higher-order structures involving multiple nucleosomes are formed -  a 30 nm fiber (forming an irregular zigzag) and a 100 nm fiber. The H1 histone also binds to the "linker DNA" (approximately 20-80 nucleotides in length) region between nucleosomes, helping stabilize the zig-zagged 30 nm fiber.



The complex structure of multiple nucleosomes, including the histones and the DNA wrapped around them, is known as chromatin.

    rdfs:comment """In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".



Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".



While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.



Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).

In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.



In many cases, purified enzymes can act in vitro using an artificial electron carrier, and their in vivo electron carrier is not known. This class of "unknown electron carriers" is used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.

Some other forms, such as |FRAME: CPD-8050|, are also found in nature, although they are less abundant.


Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.



Additional information on the nomenclature of myo-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in myo-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.



To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

Up to four acyl chains, often with a &beta; hydroxy group and usually 10 to 18 carbons in length, are attached directly to the glucosamine sugars at positions N-2 and O-3 (and N'-2 and O'-3, respectively), while additional acyl chains are attached to the &beta; hydroxy groups of some of those primary acyl chains.

Many variations are found in the structures of lipid A molecules. Further modifications are commonly observed, such as the addition or removal of phosphate groups (see |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.29|, |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.M9|, and |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.M11|), the addition of |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-ETHANOLAMINE| (see |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.43|, |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.42|, and |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.M9|), the addition of  |FRAME: 4-AMINO-4-DEOXY-L-ARABINOSE| units (see |FRAME: EC-2.4.2.43|), and further addition or removal of fatty acyl units (see |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.251| and |FRAME: EC-3.1.1.77|).

    rdfs:comment """The teichoic acids are found in a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. They include a diverse family of cell surface glycopolymers containing up to 60 phosphodiester-linked repeat units. There are two main types: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall. Five types of lipoteichoic acids |CITS: [24819367]| and four types of wall teichoic acids |CITS: [24024634]| have been described so far.


LTAs have been grouped into different types (type I through V) based on their chemical structures. Type I LTA is found in a large range of Firmicutes. It has an unbranched 1�3 linked glycerol phosphate (GroP) backbone, and is usually linked to the bacterial membrane via a glycolipid anchor. The hydroxyl groups at the C-2 position of the GroP repeating units are modified with D-alanyl or glycosyl groups to varying degrees. It should be noted that not all type I LTAs are glycosylated, and variations in the type of sugar exist. For example, some |FRAME: TAX-1386 Bacillus| strains lack glycosyl groups, some contain |FRAME: CPD-12541|, and some contain |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| |CITS: [3733670][2914853]|. The LTA of all |FRAME: TAX-1639| strains investigated to date is glycosylated with |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| |CITS: [6415040][3093460]|, and the LTA of |FRAME: TAX-1280| strain H is glycosylated with |FRAME: CPD-12541| |CITS: [6268617]|.



LTAs can be very abundant. In |FRAME: TAX-1280| every ninth lipid on the outer leaflet of the membrane is an LTA molecule, and the average length is 25 GroP units |CITS: [6697992]|. Although the exact role of LTA is unknown, mutants display significant growth and physiological defects. Teichoic acids are proposed to serve as reservoirs of phosphates that can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg2+), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides |CITS: [46620]|.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation. Menaquinones are the most widespread respiratory quinones in biological systems |CITS: [Fujimoto12]|. Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-n or DMK-n, respectively, where the n refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.



Many bacteria and archaea have |FRAME: Dihydromenaquinones "dehydrogenated menaquinones"|, which are named MK-n(H2). The degree and location of dehydrogenation depends on the species. Some organisms have menaquinones with modifications of the head group, for example |FRAME: TAX-2302| possess both |FRAME: CPD-15875 thermoplasmaquinones| (TPQ), which contains an extra methyl group, and |FRAME: CPD-15876 methionaquinones| (MTK), which contains a methylthio group |CITS: [11157962]|.



Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K2. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation.

The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K1 (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K2 (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lengths there are many variations of vitamin K2, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K2(45).

MT2 then transfers the methyl group from the corrinoid to

The second peptide, MtsB, is a corrinoid protein, similar to the one found in the other systems.

A small, separate class of opines is the |FRAME: Agrocinopines agrocinopines|, which are sugar-phosphodiesters (e.g., |FRAME: CPD-15774|, which is a phosphodiester of sucrose and L-arabinose).



While opines are found in marine invertebrates, fungi, higher plants and mammals, they are most commonly found in plant crown gall tumors or hairy root tumors, where they are produced by bacteria of the genera |FRAME: TAX-357| and |FRAME: TAX-379|, respectively. However, the first opine to be identified (in 1927), octopine, was isolated from an octopus muscle, hence its name, which was later extended for naming the opine family.



Biosynthesis of opines in crown gall tumors is performed by enzymes encoded by genes contained in T-DNA (transfer DNA), which is part of the Ti plasmid (in |FRAME: TAX-357|) or Ri plasmid (in |FRAME: TAX-379|).

They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers "iron-sulfur clusters"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential, and do not carry out classical enzyme functions. Ferredoxins characteristically transfer an electron

with a reduction potential E0' near -420mV (though the reduction potential of ferredoxins from some anaerobic microorganisms can be as low as -500mV |CITS: [Li16]| and as high as -340mV |CITS: [12610725]|).



Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins "[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis.

|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria.

bc:Respiration rdfs:comment """This class contains pathways of respiration by which various organisms generate,
both aerobically and anaerobically, a trans-membrane ion gradient to serve as a

source of energy.



Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which

electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor.

However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the

acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that

function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps

that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the

acceptor.



Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be

|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other

type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding

member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal

acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of

|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in

|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.



Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic

compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),

|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and

|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).



During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the

membrane due to three potential processes



1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active

pumping of protons across a membrane.



2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.



3. Scalar reactions that consume protons on one side of a membrane, or produce them

on the other side of the membrane, without actually moving a proton from one

compartment to another.

The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.



Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.

These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.


During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H2PteGlu1. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H4PteGlu1, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.



Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.



The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.



The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

In |FRAME: TAX-224308| the main form of teichoic acid is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-75 "poly(glycerol phosphate)"|, while in |FRAME: TAX-655816| the major variety is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-19310 "poly(ribitol phosphate)"| |CITS: [13684313]|. In both cases, the repeating units are joined together by phosphodiester linkages, and are anchored via 2-3 glycerol phosphate units to a N-acetyl-&beta;-D-mannosaminyl-(1&rarr;4)-N-acetyl-&alpha;-D-glucosamine disaccharide. The glycerol and ribitol units of the polysaccharides are modified with D-alanine esters and/or monosaccharides such as glucose or N-acetylglucosamine |CITS: [13684313][4321415]|.



It should be noted that strain 168 also possesses a |FRAME: CPD-19345 "minor form of wall teichoic acid"| that is comprised of poly(glucosyl N-acetylgalactosamine 1-phosphate) |CITS: [4202940]|). 



Teichoic acids serve several roles in the cell. They serve as reservoirs of phosphates which can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg2+), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides |CITS: [46620]|.

The enzyme attaches the ubiquitin to a lysine residue on the target protein via an isopeptide bond.
Since no ATP is required for this transfer operation, these enzymes are transferases and not ligases.



E3 ubiquitin-carrier proteins are also involved in poly-ubiquitination, building poly-ubiquitin chains by adding a second ubiquitin to the first, a third to the second, and so forth.



Chains can be added to different lysines on the ubiquitin molecule. Chains at different locations result in different fate for the ubiquitinated protein. For example, human proteins with chains of ubiquitin molecules connected via Lys48 are targeted to the proteasome for degradation, while proteins with chains of ubiquitin molecules connected via Lys63 seem to be important for DNA repair.



E3 ubiquitin-transferases contain a domain for binding the E2-ubiquitin complex and a substrate-specific domain for binding the target protein.

A different type of ETF possess electron transfer bifurcating activity: ability to accept a pair of electrons from NADH and use one to generate a strong reductant such as flavodoxin hydroquinone or reduced ferredoxin. This endergonic electron transfer is paid for by exergonic transfer of the other electron to a strong electron acceptor via a corresponding partner enzyme, such as a quinone reductase in the case of ETFs associated with nitrogen fixation, or |FRAME: CPLX-7036| (BCD) in the case of some butanoate-producing anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [14688238]|.



The bifurcating ETFs are also heterodimeric, but contain two FAD molecules (the presence of AMP has not been reported). The hydride group from NADH is transferred to the first FAD (the so-called bifurcating FAD or Bf-FAD), which passes one electron exergonically to the second FAD.

There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|.

The ceramide lipid components of brain gangliosides are dominated by a single fatty acid (|FRAME: STEARIC_ACID|) attached to one of two sphingoid bases, |FRAME: SPHINGOSINE| and |FRAME: CPD-19684| |CITS: [21113547]|.

While many non-human mammals synthesize gangliosides that contain two types of sialic acids - |FRAME: N-ACETYLNEURAMINATE| and |FRAME: CPD-273|, mammalian brain gangliosides almost exclusively carry the former.



Like other glycosphingolipids, gangliosides are biosynthesized stepwise by a series of glycosyltransferases that use nucleotide sugar donors to first glucosylate ceramide and then elongate the saccharide chain .|FRAME: Lactosyl-Ceramides Lactosylceramide|, a product of the second glycosylation step in the biosynthesis of many glycosphingolipids, is an important branching point, being a common precursor for the synthesis of the four major classes of glycosphingolipids: the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|, the |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs "globo series"|, the |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs "lacto series"|, and the |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs "neolacto series"| |CITS: [10320813]|.



The ceramide lipid of glycosphingolipids is embedded in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane, with the glycan extending  2-2.5 nm outward, perpendicular to the plane of the lipid bilayer |CITS: [19056784]|. What makes gangliosides different from other glycosphingolipids is the incorporation of sialic acids. With a mean Pka value of around 2.6, sialic acids are more acidic than the majority of carboxylic acids and negatively charged at most physiological pH values.



About the nomenclature of gangliosides



Ganglioside naming is somewhat complex. Two ganglioside nomenclature systems are currently in use. The most commonly used is a short-hand nomenclature suggested by Svennerholm, which was initially based on the migration order of |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio-series"| gangliosides in chromatography |CITS: [14066623]|. The more comprehensive system formulated by IUPAC |CITS: [9826173]| is applied much less frequently.



A typical ganglioside name using the old system looks like |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"|.

The first letter refers to the glycosphingolipid series. For example, the "G" stands for the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|. The next letter describes the number of sialic acid residues: (A = 0, M =1, D = 2, T = 3, Q = 4, P = 5, H = 6, S = 7). The following number describes the number of the non-sialic residues, and is derived in a rather complex manner. It was initially assumed that the number of such residues does not exceed 5. The number in the name was calculated as (5 - the number of uncharged carbohydrates).



In addition, several sub-series of gangliosides have been defined based on the number of sialic acids attached to the galactose residue of the lacosylceramide core. If no sialic residues are present at that position, the compounds belong to the |FRAME: 0-Series-Ganglioside "0-series�|. Those with one sialic acid at that position are named the |FRAME: A-Series-Gangliosides �a-series�|, those with two sialic acids belong to the |FRAME: B-Series-Gangliosides �b-series�|, and so on. |FRAME: C-Series-Gangliosides "C-series"| or higher gangliosides are rare in adult mammals and birds, but are abundant in fish and amphibians. Confusingly,  GM1b and GD1c are both 0-series gangliosides, despite having a �b� and �c� in their names.



So, for example, the |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"| is named as follows: G = belongs to the ganglio series, Q =  4 sialic acids, 1 = 4 non-sialic residues, and b = belongs to the b-series, meaning two of the sialic acids are attached to the inner galactose.

Ginsenosides are composed of an aglycone and sugar moieties. Based on the structure of their aglycones, ginsenosides have been categorized into three broad types; |FRAME: Protopanaxadiol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides"| (PPD), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 20, |FRAME: Protopanaxatriol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides"| (PPT), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 6 and 20, and |FRAME: Oleanonic-acid-type-ginsenosides "oleanonic-acid-type saponins"|.



Although ginsenosides only have three kinds of aglycones, more than 60 kinds of ginsenosides have been identified by now due to the variability in the type of sugar moieties, their number, and the carbon positions they link to.



The biological activity of ginsenoside increases with the decrease of the number of the sugar moieties. All of the ginsenosides found in large quantities in wild ginseng (known as major ginsenosides) are heavily glycosylated, while the more active less-glycosylated ginsenosides are found in much smalller quantities (and are commonly referred to as the

minor ginsenosides). Following oral intake of ginseng, the large low-solubility and poor-permeability major ginsenosides cannot be absorbed by the human body directly |CITS: [Su06]|, and are deglycosylated into smaller forms in the gastrointestinal tract by intestinal bacteria and/or digestive enzymes |CITS: [8923812]|.



Glycosidase enzymes that can convert the major ginsenosides to minor ginsenosides are not common and are of commercial interest.

General Background 



Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible interconversion of protons, electrons and  |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE|, resulting in |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE| oxidation to two protons or in the reverse direction, molecular hydrogen production by the reduction of protons.



Most hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that contain iron-sulfur clusters. They have been subdivided into two main classes based on the composition of two metal atoms at their active center: [NiFe] hydrogenases and [FeFe] hydrogenases. These two classes are phylogenetically distinct. It should be noted that in some of the [NiFe] hydrogenases one of the Ni-bound cysteine residues is replaced by selenocysteine. Those enzymes are known as [NiFeSe] hydrogenases. The [FeFe] hydrogenases usually have high catalytic activity, but are sensitive to irreversible inactivation by |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE|, more so than [NiFe] hydrogenases. 



While [FeFe] hydrogenases are limited to certain bacteria and a few unicellular eukaryotes, [NiFe] hydrogenases are widespread in both bacteria and archaea |CITS: [20463892]|. 



 [NiFe] hydrogenases are usually heterodimeric proteins, but can be associated with additional subunits.The large subunit contains the [NiFe] catalytic site, while the smaller subunit contains 3 FeS clusters.  These clusters transfer electrons from an external electron donor to the [NiFe] site for reduction of protons |CITS: [20463892]|.

Many [FeFe]-hydrogenases are monomeric but possess additional domains that contain FeS clusters |CITS: [18500479]|. The catalytic core of [FeFe] hydrogenases is a single domain of about 350 residues that accommodates the active site known as the H cluster.



In addition, a third class of hydrogenases is found in some methanogenic archaea. These enzymes contain only a mononuclear Fe active site and no FeS clusters, and are known as [Fe] hydrogenases.

The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif; while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site.

They were initially described in 1884 by MacMunn as respiratory pigments (originally named myohematin or histohematin) |CITS: [MacMunn84]| and were renamed cytochromes after being rediscovered in 1920.



In general cytochromes are named based on the type of heme they carry - cytochrome c contains a heme c, while cytochrome aa3 contains both a heme a and a heme a3. Often cytochromes are further designated by their reduced state R-band maximum, e.g. cyt c559.



In most cytochromes the heme group contains an iron ion, which interconverts between its reduced state (Fe2+) and its oxidized state (Fe3+). Thus, cytochromes are reduced by accepting an electron from a donor, and deliver the electron to the oxidized form of an acceptor, reducing it in the process. Cytochromes play an indispensable role in most respiratory chains and in photosynthesis.

represent the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of a protein by

creating two instances of class Proteins.  Both of those instances, in their

FEATURES slot, would contain the value F, linking to the same feature

instance.  However, in the two proteins, F would be annotated differently

to indicate the state of that feature.   One protein would use an 

annotation label STATE with a value MODIFIED to denote

that the residue is phosphorylated, and would also be classified under the class Modified-Proteins,

whereas the other would have the value UNMODIFIED for the state annotation.



Most covalent modifications to proteins can be found in the subclass Modification-Features.  For these

features, the specific class of the feature usually unambiguously defines the modification (if it does not,

the chemical structure slots can be used for that purpose).  



For cases in which a protein forms a non-covalent complex with some other entity, this is represented

using an instance of the Complexes class.  In this case, a feature may be created to specify where on the protein

the other entity binds (with the ATTACHED-GROUP slot indicating its identity), but it is rarely 

necessary to indicate the state of the feature -- interactions refer to either the

protein or the complex, but rarely need to distinguish between the complex, the protein within the complex, and the

free protein.  If however it is necessary to distinguish between those three cases, then, as in the covalent modification

case, a modified protein would need to be created, and the state (BOUND or UNBOUND) of the feature would need

to be set for each form of the protein.

Ginsenosides are composed of an aglycone and sugar moieties. Based on the structure of their aglycones, ginsenosides have been categorized into three broad types; |FRAME: Protopanaxadiol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides"| (PPD), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 20, |FRAME: Protopanaxatriol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides"| (PPT), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 6 and 20, and |FRAME: Oleanonic-acid-type-ginsenosides "oleanonic-acid-type saponins"|.



Although ginsenosides only have three kinds of aglycones, more than 60 kinds of ginsenosides have been identified by now due to the variability in the type of sugar moieties, their number, and the carbon positions they link to.



The biological activity of ginsenoside increases with the decrease of the number of the sugar moieties. All of the ginsenosides found in large quantities in wild ginseng (known as major ginsenosides) are heavily glycosylated, while the more active less-glycosylated ginsenosides are found in much smalller quantities (and are commonly referred to as the

minor ginsenosides). Following oral intake of ginseng, the large low-solubility and poor-permeability major ginsenosides cannot be absorbed by the human body directly |CITS: [Su06]|, and are deglycosylated into smaller forms in the gastrointestinal tract by intestinal bacteria and/or digestive enzymes |CITS: [8923812]|.



Glycosidase enzymes that can convert the major ginsenosides to minor ginsenosides are not common and are of commercial interest.

In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

    rdfs:comment """|About the nomenclature of gangliosides


Ganglioside naming is somewhat complex. Two ganglioside nomenclature systems are currently in use. The most commonly used is a short-hand nomenclature suggested by Svennerholm, which was initially based on the migration order of |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio-series"| gangliosides in chromatography |CITS: [14066623]|. The more comprehensive system formulated by IUPAC |CITS: [9826173]| is applied much less frequently.



A typical ganglioside name using the old system looks like |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"|.

The first letter refers to the glycosphingolipid series. For example, the "G" stands for the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|. The next letter describes the number of sialic acid residues: (A = 0, M =1, D = 2, T = 3, Q = 4, P = 5, H = 6, S = 7). The following number describes the number of the non-sialic residues, and is derived in a rather complex manner. It was initially assumed that the number of such residues does not exceed 5. The number in the name was calculated as (5 - the number of uncharged carbohydrates).



In addition, several sub-series of gangliosides have been defined based on the number of sialic acids attached to the galactose residue of the lacosylceramide core. If no sialic residues are present at that position, the compounds belong to the |FRAME: 0-Series-Ganglioside "0-series�|. Those with one sialic acid at that position are named the |FRAME: A-Series-Gangliosides �a-series�|, those with two sialic acids belong to the |FRAME: B-Series-Gangliosides �b-series�|, and so on. |FRAME: C-Series-Gangliosides "C-series"| or higher gangliosides are rare in adult mammals and birds, but are abundant in fish and amphibians. Confusingly,  GM1b and GD1c are both 0-series gangliosides, despite having a �b� and �c� in their names.



So, for example, the |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"| is named as follows: G = belongs to the ganglio series, Q =  4 sialic acids, 1 = 4 non-sialic residues, and b = belongs to the b-series, meaning two of the sialic acids are attached to the inner galactose.

Component A is a homodimer with one [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster bound in the dimer interface, while component D is a heterodimer with 1-2 [4Fe&ndash;4S] clusters and FMN. In order to catalyze the reaction, the dehydratase requires one high-energy electron that transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion, facilitating the elimination of the hydroxyl group. The electron needs to be supplied only once, before the first reaction takes place, since it is regenerated at the end of each reaction cycle. This initial activation is provided by the activator.


The activator, which has been named archerase because its open position resembles an archer shooting arrows, binds two ADP molecules. Upon the reduction of its [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster by a single electron, delivered by a dedicated flavodoxin, the two ADP molecules exchange for two ATP molecules, resulting in a large conformational change. The change results in the activator binding to the dehydratase component, upon which the two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed and the electron is transferred to the dehydratase, activating it |CITS: [15374661][18337824]|.

There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

The glucosinolates are substituted &beta;-thioglucoside N-hydroxysulfates that are formed from any one of eight amino acids, namely, |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, |FRAME: VAL|, |FRAME: LEU|, |FRAME: ILE|, |FRAME: PHE|, |FRAME: MET|, |FRAME: TYR| and |FRAME: TRP|. Over 115 naturally occurring glucosinolates have been identified. Much of the diversity amongst glucosinolates arises from the addition of different sized alkyl groups to the side chain of the amino acids, principally valine, phenylalanine and methionine |CITS: [18458837]|. They are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and indolic types, depending on whether they are derived from methionine, phenylalanine and tyrosine, or tryptophan. Indolylmethyl glucosinolates are found mainly in leaves. For a review, see |CITS: [12049923]|.



Glucosinolates are stored in the vacuole and come into contact with the enzyme |FRAME: EC-3.2.1.147| (myrosinase) upon breakage of the cell. Myrosinase de-glucosylates the glucosinolates, resulting in formation of nitriles, isothiocyanates and thiocyanates.

|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.



There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

Component A is a homodimer with one [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster bound in the dimer interface, while component D is a heterodimer with 1-2 [4Fe&ndash;4S] clusters and FMN. In order to catalyze the reaction, the dehydratase requires one high-energy electron that transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion, facilitating the elimination of the hydroxyl group. The electron needs to be supplied only once, before the first reaction takes place, since it is regenerated at the end of each reaction cycle. This initial activation is provided by the activator.


The activator, which has been named archerase because its open position resembles an archer shooting arrows, binds two ADP molecules. Upon the reduction of its [4Fe&ndash;4S] cluster by a single electron, delivered by a dedicated flavodoxin, the two ADP molecules exchange for two ATP molecules, resulting in a large conformational change. The change results in the activator binding to the dehydratase component, upon which the two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed and the electron is transferred to the dehydratase, activating it |CITS: [15374661][18337824]|.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: Peroxiredoxins Peroxiredoxins| are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes that have been identified in eubacteria, archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|. All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine (the peroxidative cysteine or Cp) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity. Substrates for peroxiredoxins include |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE "hydrogen peroxides"|, |FRAME: Alkyl-Hydro-Peroxides "alkyl hydroperoxides"|, and |FRAME: CPD0-1395 peroxynitrites|.


Depending on the specific peroxiredoxin enzyme, reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE|, |FRAME: Thioredoxin thioredoxin|, |FRAME: Glutaredoxins glutaredoxin|, cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.



The first peroxiredoxin was identified in |FRAME: TAX-4932| in 1987 and named thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA), because it was thought to remove reactive sulfur species rather than reactive oxygen species |CITS: [2895105]|. The correct functional assignment was made after the discovery of AhpC (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase) in |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [2191951]|.



All peroxiredoxins contain an L-cysteine residue that attacks the substrate (Cp) and becomes hydroxylated during the catalytic cycle. Multiple classification systems have been suggested for the peroxiredoxins, based on the mechanism for the reduction of the hydroxylated Cp residue and on sequence analysis.



According to an earlier classification system, the enzymes were categorized into three classes based on the location or absence of a second L-cysteine residue (CR) that is involved in restoring Cp to its reduced state. The three classes are:



1. |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins "2-Cys-peroxiredoxins"| (also called typical 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins) are homodimeric and contain two conserved (Cp and CR) cysteine residues per subunit. The Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the CR of the other subunit to form an intersubunit disulfide.



2. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins "Type II peroxiredoxins"|, (also called atypical 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins), are monomeric, and the Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the CR of the same subunit, forming an intrasubunit disulfide. Members of this class can use thioredoxin and/or glutaredoxin as the reductant |CITS: [12913160]|. A subtype is the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins "Q-type peroxiredoxins"|, which are homologs of the |FRAME: EG10108| (bacterioferritin co-migrating protein) of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [10998352]|.



3. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins "1-Cys-peroxiredoxins"| contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine |CITS: [8914536]|. Given the absence of a CR, Cp&ndash;SOH of 1-Cys enzymes cannot be resolved within the peroxiredoxin molecules and instead forms a disulfide with a cysteine residue provided by other proteins or small thiol molecules |CITS: [20919932]|.



In later publications the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins "Q-type peroxiredoxins"| are considered a separate 4th class |CITS: [15890615][18493039]|.



According to the second classification system, which was introduced in 2011 based on sequence analysis of more than 3500 enzymes, the enzymes are divided into six classes -  AhpC-Prx1 (identical to the typical 2-Cys class), BCP-PrxQ (named after the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: EG10108| and plant |FRAME: AT3G26060|), Tpx (named for the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: G6660|), Prx5 (named for the mammalian |FRAME: HS05016-MONOMER|), Prx6 (named for the mammalian |FRAME: CPLX-9416|, sometimes referred to as the 1-Cys group), and AhpE (named for |FRAME: TAX-1773| AhpE) |CITS: [21287625]|.



Mammalian cells express six peroxiredoxins - PrxI to PrxIV are 2-Cys, PrxV is an atypical 2-Cys, and PrxVI is 1-Cys |CITS: [11795591]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| expresses five peroxiredoxins -  Tsa1 and Tsa2 are two 2-Cys, Ahp1 and nTpx are atypical 2-Cys, and mTpx is 1-Cys |CITS: [26813659]|. The plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| expresses nine peroxiredoxins.

    rdfs:comment """The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).


The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.



Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.



Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, alcohols, and aldehydes, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:



|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.



Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the trans configuration, it is often referred to as a trans fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the trans configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

    rdfs:comment """Starch is a glucose-based polysaccharide produced by plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria. Starch combines two polymeric carbohydrates (polysaccharides) called |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses "&alpha;-amylose"| and |FRAME: CPD-7043|. |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses "&alpha;-Amylose"| contains up to several thousand &alpha;-glucosyl units linked almost exclusively in linear &alpha;(1->4) linkages, with very few branches of &alpha;(1->6) linkages. In |FRAME: CPD-7043|, on the other hand, branching is common, and occurs approximately every 24-30 glucose monomer units. Amylopectin is one of (if not the) largest biological polymer known and contains from 105&ndash;106 glucose residues |CITS: [9730163]|. Unlike |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen| molecules, which is limited to ~55,000 glucose units, the starch branched structure leads to clusters of chains that allow for indefinite growth of the polysaccharide. |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses "&alpha;-Amylose"| accounts for 30% of starch, while |FRAME: CPD-7043| accounts for the other 70%.


The dense packing of branches at the root of the clusters generates tightly packed glucan chains that are close enough to align and form parallel double helical structures. The helices within a single cluster and neighbouring clusters align and form sections of crystalline structures separated by sections of amorphous material (containing the branches) thereby generating the semi-crystalline nature of amylopectin and of the ensuing starch granule. The crystallized chains become insoluble and typically collapse into a macrogranular solid that is osmotically inert |CITS: [9730163]|. The enzymes of starch synthesis and mobilization are unable to interact directly with the solid structure, with the exception of |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.242 "granule-bound starch synthase"| |CITS: [14502990]|.



The solid semi-crystalline starch and hydrosoluble |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen| define two distinct physical states of the same type of storage polysaccharide. Glycogen is by far the most widespread form of storage, as it is found in Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryotes. The appearance of semi-crystalline storage polysaccharides appears linked to the requirement of unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria to fuel nitrogenase and protect it from oxygen through respiration of large amounts of stored carbon |CITS: [21220783]|.

    rdfs:comment """Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins contain iron atom(s) ligated by inorganic sulfide and/or at least two cysteinyl (Cys) ligands. The main function of the Fe-S active sites is electron transfer, mostly in the range of low oxidation-reduction potentials.
In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur proteins are also known to participate in the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|. Fe-S active sites are perhaps the most ancient cofactors.



The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)4]2-, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.



Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.



As mentioned above, small electron transfer proteins that contain only mononuclear [Fe(Cys)4]2- complexes are called |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 



Many complex Fe-S proteins contain multiple clusters arranged in chains, separated 1 - 1.4 nm apart, which allow electron transfer across considerable distances. Other electron-transferring groups such as heme or flavin may also be present. Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-7.1.1.2 "complex I"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 "complex II"| and |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.8 "complex III"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 "photosystem I"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 "xanthine dehydrogenase"|.



Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 "4Fe-4S clusters"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.



It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.

The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.

Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, alcohols, and aldehydes, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths.

Since methylation reactions are sometimes reversible, the distinction between a methyl group donor and a methyl group acceptor is not always determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some compounds are often used as methyl group donors by the methyltransferases in reactions that are physiologically unidirectional.



By far, the most common methyl group donor in biology is |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|. However, other methyl donors exist, including |FRAME: METOH|, |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N "N5-methyl tetrahydrofolate"|, |FRAME: METHYL-THMPT|, |FRAME: METHYLAMINE|, |FRAME: DIMETHYLAMINE|, |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE|, and |FRAME: CPD-7671|.



This generic class can be used in reactions when the identity of the methyl group donor (or acceptor) is not known or cannot be defined.

Ginsenosides are composed of an aglycone and sugar moieties. Based on the structure of their aglycones, ginsenosides have been categorized into three broad types; |FRAME: Protopanaxadiol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides"| (PPD), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 20, |FRAME: Protopanaxatriol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides"| (PPT), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 6 and 20, and |FRAME: Oleanonic-acid-type-ginsenosides "oleanonic-acid-type saponins"|.



Although ginsenosides only have three kinds of aglycones, more than 60 kinds of ginsenosides have been identified by now due to the variability in the type of sugar moieties, their number, and the carbon positions they link to.



The biological activity of ginsenoside increases with the decrease of the number of the sugar moieties. All of the ginsenosides found in large quantities in wild ginseng (known as major ginsenosides) are heavily glycosylated, while the more active less-glycosylated ginsenosides are found in much smalller quantities (and are commonly referred to as the

minor ginsenosides). Following oral intake of ginseng, the large low-solubility and poor-permeability major ginsenosides cannot be absorbed by the human body directly |CITS: [Su06]|, and are deglycosylated into smaller forms in the gastrointestinal tract by intestinal bacteria and/or digestive enzymes |CITS: [8923812]|.

When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".



Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".



While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.



Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).

They were initially described in 1884 by MacMunn as respiratory pigments (originally named myohematin or histohematin) |CITS: [MacMunn84]| and were renamed cytochromes after being rediscovered in 1920.



In general cytochromes are named based on the type of heme they carry - cytochrome c contains a heme c, while cytochrome aa3 contains both a heme a and a heme a3. Often cytochromes are further designated by their reduced state R-band maximum, e.g. cyt c559.



In most cytochromes the heme group contains an iron ion, which interconverts between its reduced state (Fe2+) and its oxidized state (Fe3+). Thus, cytochromes are reduced by accepting an electron from a donor, and deliver the electron to the oxidized form of an acceptor, reducing it in the process. Cytochromes play an indispensable role in most respiratory chains and in photosynthesis.

    rdfs:comment """|FRAME: carotenoids Carotenoids| are isoprenoid pigments in the yellow to red color range. They have conjugated double bond chains of varying length with varying substituents, which determines their light absorption spectrum. They are produced by photosynthetic organisms and some non-photosynthetic fungi and bacteria. Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.


Carotenoids have diverse functions that include participation in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, serving as antioxidants, virulence factors, and modulation of membrane function. In photosynthetic organisms carotenoids provide protection against photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments as well as light-harvest. The prominent |FRAME: CPD1F-119|, as well as |FRAME: CPD1F-130|, are involved in the reduction of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal. Carotenoids serve as precursors for the plant growth hormone |FRAME: Abscisic-Acid| and |FRAME: Vitamin-A| (for a succinct review of the applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|). In addition, they may be cleaved to |FRAME: Apocarotenoids apocarotenoids|, whose functions include serving as a cofactor for light-sensing proteins, acting as hormones, or acting as antifungals. Carotenoids have been the subject of metabolic pathway engineering studies because microbial carotenoid production is environmentally preferable to chemical synthesis.



Over 700 carotenoids have been identified. The two main structural classes of carotenoids are the |FRAME: Carotenes carotenes| and the |FRAME: Xanthophylls xanthophylls|, which are composed of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons, respectively. 

Most carotenoids have a C40 chain length derived from the symmetric precursor |FRAME: CPD-12321| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6287|). |FRAME: CPD-12321| is derived from |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP|, which is in turn derived from |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| and |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5120|). 



Larger, C50 carotenoids also occur in nature and appear to be derived from the addition of two isoprene units to a C40 carotenoid.  Although biosynthetic intermediates and novel bacterial genes involved in C50 carotenoid biosynthesis from |FRAME: CPD1F-114| have been identified and biosynthetic pathways postulated, details of all of the enzyme reactions involved in these pathways remain to be determined (as in |CITS: [20802040] [17008032] [11511870] [11432736]|).



Smaller, C30 carotenoids have also been found in plants and microorganisms.  In microorganisms they appear to be synthesized by a distinct C30 pathway, whereas in plants they appear to result from cleavage of C40 carotenoids.  |FRAME: CPD-9911| is a bacterial C30 carotenoid derived from |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP|.  It is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite |FRAME: CPD-9916| in |FRAME: TAX-1280| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5875|).  |FRAME: CPD-9911| has also been identified in a few other bacteria |CITS: [20303609] [9297464]|.

In most cytochromes the heme group contains an iron ion, which interconverts between its reduced state (Fe2+) and its oxidized state (Fe3+).

Glycosaminoglycans are divided into four main classes: |FRAME: Chondroitin-sulfates| and |FRAME: Dermatan-Sulfate|; |FRAME: HEPARIN| and |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate|;  |FRAME: Hyaluronan|; and |FRAME: KERATAN-6-SULFATE "keratan sulfate"|. With the exception of hyaluronan, the polysaccharide chains are linked covalently at the reducing end to a core protein through an O-glycosidic linkage to a serine residue. The modified proteins are known as |FRAME: Proteoglycans proteoglycans|.



Most glycosaminoglycans are attached via a specific tetrasaccharide known as the |FRAME: GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Proteins "glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region"|.

While iron(II) is souble, it is rapidly oxidized in the presence of oxygen into insoluble ferric oxyhydroxides. In addition, iron is often complexed with organic molecules. The concentration of free iron in body fluids is estimated to be about 10-18 M |CITS: [12655062]|. The most common iron uptake mechanism used by microorganisms are ferrisiderophore acquisition systems.


Siderophores are small organic compounds with a very high affinity for iron. Once secreted into the environment, siderophores efficiently solubilize and chelate iron(III). The iron-siderophore complexes (ferrisiderophores) are imported back into the cell by specific transport systems, crossing both the outer and inner membranes |CITS: [23046646]|. Once in the cytoplasm (and in some cases, in the periplasm), iron is released from siderophores by hydrolysis, proton-assisted dissociation of the complex, or reduction of the metal center |CITS: [23443998]|.



Siderophores are very common in pathogenic bacteria, since iron in the host organism is usually tightly bound to proteins, resulting in an extremely low concentration of free iron in the blood.



More than 500 different siderophores have now been identified. The most common siderophore use hydroxamate and/or catechol functions, attached to either linear or cyclic scaffolds, to form a hexadentate structure. Siderophore with lower denticity (tetradentate, tridentate, and bidentate) are also produced, but have a much lower affinity toward iron(III). In general, all siderophores possess a higher affinity for iron(III) than for iron(II) |CITS: [20376388]|.



Most siderophores belong to one of three major groups: the |FRAME: Catecholate-siderophores "catechols"|, |FRAME: Hydroxamate-siderophores "hydroxamates"| and |FRAME: Thiazoline-siderophores "thiazolines"|.

Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization.

Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 



In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur clusters are also known to participate in

the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes

The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential, and do not carry out classical enzyme functions. Ferredoxins characteristically transfer an electron

with a reduction potential E0' near -420mV (though the reduction potential of ferredoxins from some anaerobic microorganisms can be as low as -500mV |CITS: [Li16]| and as high as -340mV |CITS: [12610725]|).



Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins "[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6| held in place by four L-cysteine residues. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaced by histidine residues.



|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria.

Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.

The two cysteine residues almost always occur in the amino-acid sequence CXXCH |CITS: [10647174]|, with the histidine also playing an important role as an axial ligand |CITS: [15801911]|.


C-type cytochromes possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes. In general, the differences in c-type cytochromes among bacteria are much larger than those among animal species. The use of the term "c-type cytochromes" was introduced to distinguish this family of diverse proteins from the well-characterized mitochondrial protein, which is often referred to as "cytochrome c".



Bacterial c-type cytochromes function in the electron transport chains of bacteria with many different types of energy metabolism, including phototrophs, methylotrophs, denitrifiers, sulfate reducers and the nitrogen-fixers. 



The |FRAME: Cytochromes-c "C-type cytochromes"| have been classified in four classes based on their sequence (reviewed in |CITS: [1646017]|):

Memebers of this class were further subdivided into the five subclasses, IA to IE, which are named long cytochrome c2, mitochondrial cytochrome c, split-a-band cytochromes c, cytochrome c8 and cytochrome c5, respectively .



|FRAME: Class-II-Cytochromes-C "Class II"| includes the high-spin cytochromes c' and various low-spin cytochromes (e.g., Rhodopseudomonas palustris cytochrome c-556). The heme-attachment site is close to the C-terminus and in the low-spin proteins the sixth ligand is a methionine residue close to the N-terminus.



|FRAME: Class-III-Cytochromes-C "Class III"| comprises the low redox potential multiple heme cytochromes c3 and c7, with only around thirty residues of amino acid per heme group.



|FRAME: Class-IV-Cytochromes-C "Class IV"| was created to hold the complex proteins that have other prosthetic groups as well as heme c, such as the flavocytochromes c and the cytochromes cd.

However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as n or &omega;).

In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

Xyloglucan interacts with cellulose microfibrils via hydrogen bonds to form a structural network that is assumed to play a key role in cell wall integrity. Cross-linking between the xyloglucan chains is a major factor in the stability of the resulting three-dimensional matrix |CITS: [Whitney95]|.



Xyloglucan has a backbone of &beta;-1,4-linked glucose residues, most of which are substituted in C-6 by &alpha;-D-xylosyl residues |CITS: [8252539]|. In most plants some of the xylosyl residues are further substituted by (1,2)-&beta;-D-galactosyl residues, and some of the galactosyl residues are capped by (1,2)-&alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[12837954] [17011813]|. Other types of xyloglucans, for example those found in the Poaeceae and Solanaceae, feature xylose units that bear &alpha;-L-arabinosyl instead of &beta;-D-galactosyl residues.



A common terminology uses G for basic non-substituted glucosyl units within a xylosylglycan, X for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, L for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose and &beta;-D-galactose, and F for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, &beta;-D-galactose and &alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[Fry93]|.

Fucosyl residues are typically absent from seed xyloglucans but present on the xyloglucans in the vegatative portions of the same plant |CITS: [Mishra09]|.

    rdfs:comment """The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).


The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.



Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.



Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, alcohols, and aldehydes, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:



|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.



Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the trans configuration, it is often referred to as a trans fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the trans configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

The lipid portion is embedded in the outer plasma membrane leaflet and the sugar chains extended to the outer environment, acting as an antigen. Together with |FRAME: Glycoproteins glycoproteins| and |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans glycosaminoglycans|, the glycosphingolipids contribute to the glycocalyx that covers eukaryotic cell surfaces.


Glycoshphingolipids have been classified into the following 12 series based on their structure: |FRAME: Arthro-Series-GSLs arthro|, |FRAME: Gala-Series-GSLs gala|, |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs ganglio|, |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs globo|, |FRAME: Isoglobo-Series-GSLs isoglobo|, |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs lacto|, |FRAME: Muco-Series-GSLs muco|, |FRAME: Mollu-Series-GSLs mollu|, |FRAME: Neogala-Series-GSLs neogala|, |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs neolacto|, |FRAME: Schisto-Series-GSLs schisto| and |FRAME: Spirometo-Series-GSLs spirometo| |CITS: [25969757]|.



Glycosphingolipids are synthesized by the sequential addition of sugar residues to ceramide by glycosyltransferases that are specific to each glycosidic linkage.



|FRAME: Lactosyl-Ceramides Lactosylceramide|, a product of the second glycosylation step in the biosynthesis of many glycosphingolipids, is an important branching point, being a common precursor for the synthesis of the four major classes of glycosphingolipids: the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|, the |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs "globo series"|, the |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs "lacto series"|, and the |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs "neolacto series"| |CITS: [10320813]|.

bc:Fatty-Acids rdfs:label "a fatty acid" ;
    rdfs:comment """The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).


The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.



Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.



Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, |FRAME: Fatty-Alcohols alcohols|, and |FRAME: Fatty-Aldehydes aldehydes|, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:



|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.



|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.



Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the trans configuration, it is often referred to as a trans fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the trans configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

bc:Polyisoprenoids rdfs:label "an isoprenoid" ;
    rdfs:comment """The nomenclature of isoprenoids and their derivatives is somewhat confusing. Here are some guidelines for understanding these names:


Isoprenoids are composed of repeating isoprene units. The units can be attached in either a trans conformation (the two carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond) or a cis conformation (the two carbons are on the same side of the double bond). It is common to use E and Z instead of trans and cis , respectively.



The numbering of carbons in the molecule starts from the carbon attached to the hydroxyl or phosphate group. The isoprene unit furthest from the C1 carbon is called the &omega; unit. Unlike all other isoprene units, the &omega; unit is not a stereo center since the last carbon is attached to two identical methyl groups.



There are two widely used naming systems, and unfortunately they refer to the isoprene units in opposite order.

One method describes the molecule starting with the unit with the lowest carbon number (ie the one furthest from the &omega; unit), naming each of the stereo-active carbons by its number, followed by its stereo designation. For example, |FRAME:CPD-11977 "this molecule"| is referred to as 2,6-cis,10-trans-tetraprenyl diphosphate or (2Z,6Z,10E)-tetraprenyl diphosphate.

According to the other method, the molecule is described by the stereoconfiguration of the molecule starting with the &omega; unit. For example |FRAME:CPD-11977| is referred to as &omega;,E,Z,Z tetraprenyl diphosphate. 



On top of this, many of the shorter molecules have trivial names that are commonly used. Some of these names are specific for a particular stereoisomer and some are used for all stereoisomer. For example, |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP "geranylgeranyl diphosphate"| is commonly used for the all-trans isomer of the molecule with four isoprene units, while farnesyl diphosphate is used for all four isomers of the molecule with three isoprene units - |FRAME:FARNESYL-PP|, |FRAME:CPD-9444|, |FRAME:CPD-11293| and |FRAME:CPD-11990|.

There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.



The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 



While some AARSs are highly specific already in the activation reaction, others are less accurate. It has been estimated that around half of AARSs cannot achieve the tolerable level of fidelity in protein biosynthesis (estimated to be 1 in 3300) |CITS: [4643706]| in the synthetic reactions alone. For example, class I isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) activates |FRAME: VAL| only 200-fold less efficiently than its cognate amino acid cognate |FRAME: ILE| |CITS: [321008]|. Class I valyl- and leucyl-tRNA synthetases (ValRS and LeuRS), as well as a number of class II AARS, also efficiently activate noncognate amino acids and transfer them to tRNA |CITS: [182209][3534789][19379069]|.



In order to overcome these errors the AARSs developed hydrolytic proofreading activities. Two types of correction mechanisms are known: In pre-transfer editing, the AARS hydrolyzes the noncognate amino acid adenylate prior to transfer to the tRNA, while in post-transfer editing a misacylated tRNA is hydrolyzed after a noncognate amino acid is transferred to it.

The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.



This class encompasses uncharged tRNA molecules. The structure shown here depicts the CCA nucleotides at the 3' end of an uncharged tRNA.
